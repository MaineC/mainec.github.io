Backstory # Back when it came out in winter 2022 I started playing around with ChatGPT - mostly to generate texts from individual terms given as what teachers in German primary schools call &amp;ldquo;learning words&amp;rdquo; - usually they are handed out for pupils to get prepared for a dictation (written to check spelling skills): It&amp;rsquo;s a lot more fun to prepare for theses tests with fun texts than with mere lists of words :) Back then the results were impressive - but also frightning given the implications for ease of generating mis-information, fake social media profiles, spamming search indeces and more.</description></item><item><title>Note to self: Backup bottlenecks</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/note-to-self-backup-bottlenecks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2014 18:26:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/note-to-self-backup-bottlenecks/</guid><description>Note to self: Backup bottlenecks # I learnt the following relations the hard way 10 years ago when trying to backup a rather tiny amount of data, went through the computation again three years ago.

He installed Ubuntu server on it. At the evening we got it configured to run Hadoop. Little later we found out that some friends of us probably, maybe have some usable hardware left as well - we&amp;rsquo;ll see on Monday.</description></item><item><title>The 7 deadly sins of (Java) software developers</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/the-7-deadly-sins-of-java-software-developers407/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2010 09:09:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/the-7-deadly-sins-of-java-software-developers407/</guid><description>The 7 deadly sins of (Java) software developers # On Lucid Imaginations Blog Jay Hill published a great article on The seven deadly sins of solr.

The first option the wiki proposes is to take a pre-0.21 release and patch that to work with the current Dumbo release. The second option described takes the not-yet-released version of Hadoop that can be used w/o any patches.</description></item><item><title>Dev House Berlin 2.0</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/dev-house-berlin-20152/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2009 20:04:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/dev-house-berlin-20152/</guid><description>Dev House Berlin 2.0 # This weekend DevHouseBerlin took place in the Box119, kindly organized by Jan Lehnardt, sponsored by Upstream and StudiVZ. There were about 30 people gathered in Friedrichshain, hacking and discussing various projects: Mostly Python/ Django, Ruby/ Rails and Erlang people. The first day was reserved for hacking and exchanging ideas. Late afternoon attendees put together a list of talks that were than rated, ranked with the top three chosen for presentation on Sunday.</description></item><item><title>One year coding with "Das Keyboard"</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/one-year-coding-with-das-keyboard314/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2009 19:47:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/one-year-coding-with-das-keyboard314/</guid><description>One year coding with &amp;ldquo;Das Keyboard&amp;rdquo; # Little more than a year ago, I got myself a keyboard from newthinking store. The special thing about it: It is completely black, except for three blue LEDs. With completely I mean no labels on any key:
My main motivation to buy the thing was not the missing labels (although that certainly does make it a cool gadget). I am typing 8h at work and do spend quite a bit of time in front of my laptop after work as well.</description></item><item><title>Apache Con drawing closer</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-con-drawing-closer17/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2009 06:47:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-con-drawing-closer17/</guid><description>Apache Con drawing closer # By November I will be traveling to Oakland - for me it is the first Apache Con US ever.

I will be presenting Apache Mahout, give an overview of the project, of our current status and explain which problems can be solved with the current implementation. The talks will conclude with an outlook to upcoming tasks and features our users can expect in the near future.</description></item><item><title>gnuplot tutorial link</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/gnuplot-tutorial-link212/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2009 12:30:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/gnuplot-tutorial-link212/</guid><description>gnuplot tutorial link # As I am happily watching myself searching for the gnuplot tutorial over and over again - the direct link stored here to save future searching:

Slides are available online.
First Matthias motivated the need for an open standard for messaging: So far, their are a few provides of middleware systems like Tibco and IBM. But those solutions are usually closed, expensive, cumbersome to handle. In short they do not fit into a world where people rely on open standards for communication, free software for development and lightweight implementations.</description></item><item><title>Solr at AOL</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/solr-at-aol376/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2009 13:06:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/solr-at-aol376/</guid><description>Solr at AOL # Grant Ingersoll has posted a very interesting interview with Ian Holsman on Solr at Relegance, now AOL.
