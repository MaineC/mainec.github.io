to run dynamic languages on the JVM by writing a JavaScript implementation as a
proof of concept that is fully ECMA compliant and still performs better than
Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s project Rhino.
It was nice to see Lisp, created in 1962, referenced as being the first
language that featured a JIT compiler as well as garbage collection.</description></item></channel></rss>
