We had five students give talks.
The talks started with an introduction to map reduce. Oleg Mayevskiy first explained the basic concept, than gave an overview of the parallelization architecture and finally showed how jobs can be formulated as map reduce jobs.
His paper as well as his slides are available online.</description></item><item><title>Videos are up</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/videos-are-up429/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2009 07:31:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/videos-are-up429/</guid><description>Videos are up # As of yesterday the videos of the last Apache Hadoop Get Together Berlin are available online.
