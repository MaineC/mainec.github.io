Living in a large city, it is not exactly easy to get in touch with donkeys or sheep. A very simple way to combine all three preferences here is to visit Tierpark Berlin. Being larger than your average zoo, most bawns are rather roomy with lots space outside and inside.
Little more than one year ago I received a great birthday present from Thilo: It is possible to purchase a one year ticket for that park.</description></item></channel></rss>
