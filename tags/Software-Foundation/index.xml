They have put online a few ideas on what to do that day. I&amp;rsquo;d like to add one additional option: If you are using any free software and you feel the urgent need to file a bug report on that day, use the opportunity to submit a patch as well: Make sure to not only describe what is going wrong but add a patch that contains a test to show the issue and a code modification that fixes the issue, is compatible with the project&amp;rsquo;s coding guidelines, doesn&amp;rsquo;t break anything else in the project.</description></item><item><title>Talking people into submitting patches</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/talking-people-into-submitting-patches388/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 20:22:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/talking-people-into-submitting-patches388/</guid><description>Talking people into submitting patches # In November I am going to attend Apache Con NA. This year I decided to do a little experiment: I sumitted a talk on talking people into contributing to free software projects.

Matthias Wesendorf of Apache MyFaces was so kind to take up the discussion carrying it over to the Apache community mailing-list.

I pinged a few Apache related people I knew would attend the conference (being a speaker and a committer at some Apache project almost certainly resulted in getting a ping).</description></item><item><title>Devoxx Antwerp</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/devoxx-antwerp153/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2010 21:16:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/devoxx-antwerp153/</guid><description>Devoxx Antwerp # With 3000 attendees Devoxx is the largest Java Community conference world-wide.
