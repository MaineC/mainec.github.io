They have put online a few ideas on what to do that day. I&amp;rsquo;d like to add one additional option: If you are using any free software and you feel the urgent need to file a bug report on that day, use the opportunity to submit a patch as well: Make sure to not only describe what is going wrong but add a patch that contains a test to show the issue and a code modification that fixes the issue, is compatible with the project&amp;rsquo;s coding guidelines, doesn&amp;rsquo;t break anything else in the project.</description></item></channel></rss>
