Berlin Buzzwords is in it&amp;rsquo;s fourth year. Probably the most tedious task of all is having to select talks to make it into the final schedule. With roughly 120 submissions and roughly 30 slots to fill the result is that three quarters of all submissions have to be rejected.</description></item></channel></rss>
