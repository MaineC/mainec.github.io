What happened to JIRA might actually be known to developers who have to deal with huge legacy projects that predate the junit and dependency injection era: Over time their test base grew into a monster that was hard to maintain and didn&amp;rsquo;t help at all with making developers confident on checkin time that they would not break anything.</description></item><item><title>GeeCon - TDD and it's influence on software design</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/geecon-tdd-and-its-influence-on-software-design207/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2012 08:04:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/geecon-tdd-and-its-influence-on-software-design207/</guid><description>GeeCon - TDD and it&amp;rsquo;s influence on software design # The second talk I went to on the first day was on the influence of TDD on software design. Keith Braithwaite did a really great job of first introducing the concept of cyclomatic complexity and than showing at the example of Hudson as well as many other open source Java projects that the average and mean cyclomatic complexity of all those projects actually is pretty close to one and when plotted for all methods pretty much follows a power law distribution.</description></item><item><title>GeeCon - Randomized testing</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/geecon-randomized-testing205/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2012 08:02:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/geecon-randomized-testing205/</guid><description>GeeCon - Randomized testing # I arrived late during lunch time on Thursday for GeeCon – however just in time to listen to one of the most interesting talks when it comes to testing. Did you ever have the issue of writing code that runs well in your development environment but crashes as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s rolled out at customers only to find out that their Locale setting was causing the issues?</description></item></channel></rss>
