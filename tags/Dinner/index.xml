As it was announced less then a week ago (see post below) we were expecting no more then some 7 people &amp;hellip; we ended up being a group of 15 attendees: There was Michi Busch from Twitter together with Tanja, Uwe Schindler from Bremen joined us.</description></item><item><title>Apache Dinner Berlin - August 2010</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-berlin-august-201131/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2010 14:52:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-berlin-august-201131/</guid><description>Apache Dinner Berlin - August 2010 # Simon (Willnauer) just sent around the following e-mail. If you have some time left next Monday evening, come join us in Yogihaus: For tasty Indian food, geeky discussions and a generally beautiful evening.
Unlike the other dinner mails this one is not a poll, it&amp;rsquo;s an announcement. Some Apache folks are in town next monday (9th of August) so we decided to have a Apache Dinner with a short term notice.</description></item><item><title>Apache Dinner June 2010</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-june-201035/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2010 23:54:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-june-201035/</guid><description>Apache Dinner June 2010 # After Berlin Buzzwords was over yesterday - and as there is an svn conference in the city that starts tomorrow, we thought we could easily put together a smallish Apache Dinner for tonight. So Torsten mailed a few people, booked some space at Heinz Minki in Kreuzberg. We announced it at the end of the conference and invited people to join us.
So after a beautiful day out I spent the evening with a bunch of Apache related guys and girls having drinks and great pizza: We had several svn committers, Greg Stein met us there - he arrived today for the svn conference.</description></item><item><title>Apache Dinner - May 2010</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-may-201027/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2010 22:50:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-may-201027/</guid><description>Apache Dinner - May 2010 # This evening a bunch of Apache committers and friends gathered in Berlin Kreuzberg at &amp;ldquo;Goodmorning Vietnam&amp;rdquo; for tasty food, nice drinks - or put another way, for a very nice evening. Simon had booked the table - we were expecting no more than eight people. However, as with any user group these meetup tends to grow. Shortly after the appointed time we had to move to another table to fit everyone around.</description></item><item><title>Apache Dinner - April 2010</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-april-201026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2010 21:43:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-dinner-april-201026/</guid><description>Apache Dinner - April 2010 # Today, the April Apache Dinner took place in Berlin.

We were six people: Lars Trieloff from Day Software, Simon Willnauer and Vera from Lucene, Torsten Curdt - currently Freelancer and Daniel Naber from Lucene as well.
With great food, nice discussions and a first glimpse on the submissions for Berlin Buzzwords it quickly got later and later :)</description></item><item><title>Third Apache Dinner Berlin</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/third-apache-dinner-berlin409/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2010 22:04:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/third-apache-dinner-berlin409/</guid><description>Third Apache Dinner Berlin # Today the third Dinner for Apache committers and friends took place in Berlin.
