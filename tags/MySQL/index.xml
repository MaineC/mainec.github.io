Second day at FOSDEM for me started with the MySQL dev room. One thing that made me smile was in the MySQL new features talk: The speaker announced support for “NoSQL interfaces” to MySQL. That is kind of fun in two dimensions: A) What he really means is support for the memcached interface. Given the vast number of different interfaces to databases today, announcing anything as “supports NoSQL interfaces” sounds kind of silly.</description></item><item><title>Apache Con – last day</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-con-last-day14/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2010 23:23:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-con-last-day14/</guid><description>Apache Con – last day # Day three of Apache Con started with interesting talks on Tomcat 7, including an introduction to the new features of that release. Those include better memory leak prevention and detection capabilities – the implementation of these capabilities have lead to the discovery of various leaks that appear under more or less weird circumstances in famous open source libraries and the JVM itself. But also better management and reporting facilities are part of the new release.</description></item></channel></rss>
