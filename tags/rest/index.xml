Despite a few minor glitches and the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; long BBQ line the conference was very well organised and again brought together a very diverse crowd of people including but not limited to Debian developers, OpenOffice people, FSFE representatives, KDE and Gnome developers, people with background in Lisp, Clojure, PHP, Java, C and HTML5.
The first talk we went to was given by JThijssen on REST in practice.</description></item></channel></rss>
