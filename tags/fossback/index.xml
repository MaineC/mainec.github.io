By now reviews have been done, speakers notified and a schedule created. I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to find both - a lot of friends from the Apache Software Foundation but also a great many speakers that aren&amp;rsquo;t affiliated with the ASF among the speakers. If you want to know how Open Source really works, if you want to get a glimpse behind the stage, do not wait for too long to grab your ticket now and join us in summer in Berlin/ Germany.</description></item></channel></rss>
