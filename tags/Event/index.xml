to run dynamic languages on the JVM by writing a JavaScript implementation as a
proof of concept that is fully ECMA compliant and still performs better than
Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s project Rhino.
It was nice to see Lisp, created in 1962, referenced as being the first
language that featured a JIT compiler as well as garbage collection.</description></item><item><title>JAX: Tales from production</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-tales-from-production246/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 20:38:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-tales-from-production246/</guid><description>JAX: Tales from production # In a second presentation Peter RoÃbach together with Andreas Schmidt provided
some more detail on what the topic logging entails in real world projects.
Development messages turn into valuable information needed to uncover issues
and downtime of systems, capacity planning, measuring the effect of software
changes, analysing resource usage under real world usage. In addition to these
technical use cases there is a need to provide business metrics.</description></item><item><title>JAX: Logging best practices</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-logging-best-practices243/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 20:37:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-logging-best-practices243/</guid><description>JAX: Logging best practices # The ideal outcome of Peter RoÃbach&amp;rsquo;s talk on logging best practices was to have
attendees leave the room thinking ``we know all this already and are applying
it successfully&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; - most likely though the majority left thinking about how to
implement even the most basic advise discussed.
From his consultancy and fire fighter background he has a good overview of what

His main point - supported with dozens of illustrative examples was for
software developers to stop trusting in word of mouth, cargo cult like myths
that are abundant among engineers. Again the goal should be to write readable
code above all - for one the Java compiler and JIT are great at optimising.</description></item><item><title>JAX: Does parallel equal performant?</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-does-parallel-equal-performant239/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2013 20:34:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-does-parallel-equal-performant239/</guid><description>JAX: Does parallel equal performant? # In general there is a tendency to set parallel implementations to being equal
to performant implementations. Except in the really naive case there is always
going to be some overhead due to scheduling work, managing memory sharing and
network communication overhead. Essentially that knowledge is reflected in
Amdahl&amp;rsquo;s law (the amount of serial work limits the benefit from running parts

which kinds of performance problems can be observed in production and how to
best root-cause them.
Simply put performance issues usually arise due to a difference in either data
volumn, concurrency levels or resource usage between the dev, qa and production
environments. The tooling to uncover and explain them is pretty well known:</description></item><item><title>JAX: Java HPC by Norman Maurer</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-java-hpc-by-norman-maurer241/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2013 20:31:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/jax-java-hpc-by-norman-maurer241/</guid><description>JAX: Java HPC by Norman Maurer # For slides see also: Speakerdeck: High performance networking on the JVM
Norman started his talk clarifying what he means by high scale: Anything above

In her talk she shared insights into a topic commonly encountered in open source leadership that is way less often talked about than should be the case: Being in the role of a community leader people will talk to you about all sorts of confidential information and ask you to not share that information with other no matter how beneficial that might be for both parties.</description></item><item><title>On making Libre Office suck less – a major refactoring effort - FOSDEM 08</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/on-making-libre-office-suck-less-a-major-refactoring-effort-fosdem-08307/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2013 20:47:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/on-making-libre-office-suck-less-a-major-refactoring-effort-fosdem-08307/</guid><description>On making Libre Office suck less – a major refactoring effort - FOSDEM 08 # Libre Office is currently in a phase of code cleanup and refactoring that turns the whole code base upside down. What that means is that people need tooling to avoid quality from going down and allow for new features going in without too much risk.

It&amp;rsquo;s just plain amazing to see a machine boot in roughly one second (that is not counting the 7s that the BIOS needs for initialization). The whole project started as a init-only project but has since grown to a much larger purpose: An init platform ranging from mobile, embedded, desktop devices to servers many features were just over-due across the board.</description></item><item><title>Notes on storage options - FOSDEM 05</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/notes-on-storage-options-fosdem-05300/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2013 20:43:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/notes-on-storage-options-fosdem-05300/</guid><description>Notes on storage options - FOSDEM 05 # On MySQL
Second day at FOSDEM for me started with the MySQL dev room. One thing that made me smile was in the MySQL new features talk: The speaker announced support for “NoSQL interfaces” to MySQL. That is kind of fun in two dimensions: A) What he really means is support for the memcached interface. Given the vast number of different interfaces to databases today, announcing anything as “supports NoSQL interfaces” sounds kind of silly.</description></item><item><title>AFERO GPL Panel discussion - FOSDEM 04</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/afero-gpl-panel-discussion-fosdem-047/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2013 20:41:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/afero-gpl-panel-discussion-fosdem-047/</guid><description>AFERO GPL Panel discussion - FOSDEM 04 # The panel started with a bit of history of the AGPL: Born in the age of growing ASP (application service provider) businesses AGPL tried to fix the hosting loop whole in GPL in the early 2000s.

First the speaker summarized what kind of requests he gets most:
There are lots of technical support requests.
Next on the top list is the question for whether or not shipping Mozilla with a set of modifications is ok.
