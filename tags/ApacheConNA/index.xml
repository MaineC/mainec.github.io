as an Apache httpd module - working around most of the safety measures and
design decisions in the current httpd version. Essentially to get httpd to
support the protocol all you need now is mod_spdy plus a modified version of
mod_ssl.
The keynote on the last day was given by the Puppet founder.</description></item><item><title>ApacheConNA: Hadoop metrics</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconna-hadoop-metrics99/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2013 20:25:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconna-hadoop-metrics99/</guid><description>ApacheConNA: Hadoop metrics # Have you ever measured the general behaviour of your Hadoop jobs? Have you
sized your cluster accordingly? Do you know whether your work load really is IO

Linked.In, formerly Y! ever did this analysis for his clusters.

But still vital enough to wake up people from well earned sleep at night when
done wrong. Rainer Jung provided some valuable insights on how to monitor Apache httpd and Tomcat.
Of course failure detection, alarms and notifications are all part of good
monitoring. However so is avoidance of false positives and metric collection,</description></item><item><title>ApacheConNA: On Security</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconna-on-security105/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2013 20:22:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconna-on-security105/</guid><description>ApacheConNA: On Security # During the security talk at Apache Con a topic commonly glossed over by
developers was covered in quite some detail: With software being developed that
is being deployed rather widely online (over 50% of all websites are powered
by the Apache webserver) natually security issues are of large concern.
Currently there are eight trustworthy people on the foundation-wide security

what documentation to create for a project and how to go about that task.
One way to think about documentation is to keep in mind that it fulfills
different tasks: There is conceptual, procedural and task-reference
documentation. When starting to analyse your docs you may first want to debug</description></item><item><title>ApacheConNA: On delegation</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/on-delegation103/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2013 20:19:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/on-delegation103/</guid><description>ApacheConNA: On delegation # In her talk on delegation Deb Nicholson touched upon a really important topic in
OSS: Your project may live longer than you are willing to support it yourself.
The first important point about delegation is to delegate - and to not wait
until you have to do it. Soon you will realise that mentoring and delegation
actually is a way to multiply your resources.
In order to delegate people to delegate to are needed.</description></item><item><title>ApacheConNA: First keynote</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconna-first-keynote98/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2013 20:13:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconna-first-keynote98/</guid><description>ApacheConNA: First keynote # All three ApacheCon keynotes were focussed around the general theme of open
