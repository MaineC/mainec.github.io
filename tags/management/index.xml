He then went into more detail on some best practices that worked for his company as well as for himself.
When it comes to managing your energy the trick mainly is to find the right balance between isolating work from private live (by having a separate area in your home, having a daily routine with fixed start and end times) and integrating work into your daily live and loving what you do: The more boring your job is, the less likely you are going to succeed when working remotely.</description></item><item><title>GeeCon - failing software projects fast and rapidly</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/geecon-failing-software-projects-fast-and-rapidly203/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2012 08:04:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/geecon-failing-software-projects-fast-and-rapidly203/</guid><description>GeeCon - failing software projects fast and rapidly # My second day started with a talk on how to fail projects fast and rapidly.

Though no talk was scheduled for this evening the room was packed with guests from various companies and backgrounds interested in participating in discussions on Scrum.
As usual we started collecting topics (timeboxed to five minutes). The list was rather short, however it contained several interesting pieces:

The event was scheduled pretty shortly
still quite a few developers and project managers from various companies in Berlin showed up.
