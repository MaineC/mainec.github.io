This year however I was tricked into using public transport instead: a) After my husband found a new job, we now share some of the route to work - and he isn&amp;rsquo;t crazy going by bike when it&amp;rsquo;s snowing. b) I got myself a Nexus7 earlier this month which obsoleted having to take paper books with me when using public transport.</description></item><item><title>Book: Search Patterns</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/book-search-patterns127/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2012 20:41:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/book-search-patterns127/</guid><description>Book: Search Patterns # I got the book months ago during FOSDEM - the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly book table always is a pretty dangerous place as a meeting point for me: Search Patterns - Design for Discovery is one of those small, deceivingly beautiful books that manages to explain effective search engine design by focusing on the end user needs but going into some detail concerning the basics of search engine backends as well.</description></item><item><title>Apprenticeship patterns (O'Reilly)</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apprenticeship-patterns-oreilly106/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2010 08:17:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apprenticeship-patterns-oreilly106/</guid><description>Apprenticeship patterns (O&amp;rsquo;Reilly) # A few days ago I finished reading the book &amp;ldquo;Apprenticeship Patterns&amp;rdquo; - Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman, by
