Second day at FOSDEM for me started with the MySQL dev room. One thing that made me smile was in the MySQL new features talk: The speaker announced support for “NoSQL interfaces” to MySQL. That is kind of fun in two dimensions: A) What he really means is support for the memcached interface. Given the vast number of different interfaces to databases today, announcing anything as “supports NoSQL interfaces” sounds kind of silly.</description></item><item><title>Linux vs. Hadoop - some inspiration?</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/linux-vs-hadoop-some-inspiration265/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2013 20:22:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/linux-vs-hadoop-some-inspiration265/</guid><description>Linux vs. Hadoop - some inspiration? # This (even for my blog’s standards) long-ish blog post was inspired by a talk given late last year at Apache Con EU as well as from discussions around what constitutes “Apache Hadoop compatibility” and how to make extending Hadoop easier.

One major issue in schema design in the choice of key. Simplest recommendation is to make sure that keys are designed such that on reading data load will be evenly distributed accross all nodes to prevent region-server hot-spotting. General advise here are hashing or reversing urls.
When it comes to running your own HBase cluster make sure you know what is going on in the cluster at any point in time:</description></item><item><title>ApacheConEU - part 04</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconeu-part-0491/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2012 20:46:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconeu-part-0491/</guid><description>ApacheConEU - part 04 # The second talk I went to was the one on the dev@hadoop.a.o insights given by Steve Loughran.
