The result this morning: a few cm (as in about 20) of snow - that is a white christmas everyone had been looking forward to. Just one question: Where to put all that snow when digging out my car? ;)
Thanks to snow clearing services streets are all white but well drivable. Other than that lots of time for enjoying the white weather.</description></item><item><title>Frau Holle, Frau Holle</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/frau-holle-frau-holle192/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2010 18:32:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/frau-holle-frau-holle192/</guid><description>Frau Holle, Frau Holle # Winter arrived in Germany - below a few pictures I took last Thursday morning:

Looks a little like Christmas is drawing closer. Only disadvantage of the weather: One of the breaks of my bike was frozen after very few minutes. Luckily for me, my bike has one of those old-fashioned back pedal brakes ;)</description></item><item><title>"Schneeflöckchen, Weißröckchen"</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/winter-finally2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2009 09:23:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/winter-finally2/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Schneeflöckchen, Weißröckchen&amp;rdquo; # First snow seen this morning - seems like finally it&amp;rsquo;s winter:</description></item></channel></rss>
