It is a pretty traditional, old-fashioned and very lovely cinema that has specialised on showing non-dubbed, original versions of movies.
Showing the great movie Inglourious Basterds, the cinema was completely sold out today. Fortunately we were able to grab some of the last tickets.
Just in case the entrance seemed familiar to those who have attended a Mahout presentation in the recent past - a picture of the Odeon usually visualises one part of my motivation on the Mahout slides ;)</description></item></channel></rss>
