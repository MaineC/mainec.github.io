Among many interesting talks they hosted a panel to answer questions around all things open source, strategy, inner source, open development. One of the questions I found intersting is how inner source/ open development and agile are related.

Judging from the way some people become overly careful when discussing agile in general and Scrum in particular in my presence I seem to slowly have built up a reputation for being a strong proponent of these methods. Given the large number of flaky implementations as well as misunderstandings it seems to have become fashionable to blame Scrum for all badness and dismiss it altogether - up to the point where developers are proud to finally having abandoned Scrum completely - so that now they can work in iterations, accept new tasks only for upcoming but not for the current iteration, develop in a test-driven way, have daily sync meetings, mark tasks done only when they are delivered to and accepted by the customer, have regular “how to improve our work” meetings, estimate tasks in story points and only plan for as much work per iteration as was done in the past iteration</description></item><item><title>Design Thinking @ Scrumtisch Berlin</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/design-thinking-scrumtisch-berlin151/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2011 21:38:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/design-thinking-scrumtisch-berlin151/</guid><description>Design Thinking @ Scrumtisch Berlin # This evening Mary Poppendieck gave a presentation on Design Thinking in Berlin. &amp;ldquo;What does the US Military have in common with Apple?&amp;rdquo; In her talk Mary went into more detail about how increasing complexity calls for a need to rethink design. Slides are available online. Thanks for sharing them.
Mary started with a question for the audience on who in your company decides what is to be developed: Is it the PO?</description></item><item><title>Berlin Scrumtisch - February 2011</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/berlin-scrumtisch-february-2011122/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2011 21:33:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/berlin-scrumtisch-february-2011122/</guid><description>Berlin Scrumtisch - February 2011 # The February Scrumtisch Berlin featured a talk by Lyssa Adkins, famously known for her publications on Coaching Agile teams. A mixture of fifty developers, scrum masters, coaches and product owner as well as one project manager followed Marion Eikmann&amp;rsquo;s invitation. Thanks for organising the event, as well as thank you to Hypoport for providing the venue.
In her one-hour presentation she mainly focussed on two core topics: On the roles agile coaches have to fullfill as well as on the skill set needed by agile coaches.</description></item></channel></rss>
