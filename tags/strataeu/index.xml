Steve Loughran gave a very insightful talk on the various failure modes of Hadoop â€“ though the Namenode is like the most obvious single point of failure there are a few more traps waiting for those depending on their Hadoop clusters: Hadoop does just find with single harddisks failing.</description></item><item><title>Strata EU - part 3</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/strata-eu-part-3384/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 20:16:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/strata-eu-part-3384/</guid><description>Strata EU - part 3 # The first Tuesday morning keynote put the hype around big data into historical context: According to wikipedia big data apps are defined by their capability of coping with data set sizes that are larger than can be handled with commonly available machines and algorithms.
