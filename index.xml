Back in August, in the middle of my vacation, I got an e-mail from plain schwarz asking if I would be willing to give a brief talk at an event they were organising about open source.

Backstory # Back when it came out in winter 2022 I started playing around with ChatGPT - mostly to generate texts from individual terms given as what teachers in German primary schools call &amp;ldquo;learning words&amp;rdquo; - usually they are handed out for pupils to get prepared for a dictation (written to check spelling skills): It&amp;rsquo;s a lot more fun to prepare for theses tests with fun texts than with mere lists of words :) Back then the results were impressive - but also frightning given the implications for ease of generating mis-information, fake social media profiles, spamming search indeces and more.</description></item><item><title>PyCon/ PyData DE - Invited to give a keynote</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/2025_04_pyconde/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 19:29:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/2025_04_pyconde/</guid><description>How I was invited to give a keynote in Darmstadt # It was autumn 2009 at an ApacheCon in Oakland/ California: I asked one of my fellow ASF people what it would take to get him to visit Berlin.

One thing to remember: While Berlin is easy to navigate speaking only English, if you stay here for more than a couple of weeks you really truly do want to start training your German language skills: Emergency information – typically first available and more detailed in German.</description></item><item><title>Notes on meetups</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/notes_on_meetup_org/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 15:38:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/notes_on_meetup_org/</guid><description>Notes on meetup organisation # What feels like decades ago I went to a talk at FOSDEM.

Christian Grobmeier started by detailing the common requirements for all logging frameworks:
Speed - developers do not want to pay a disproportional penalty for using a logging framework.
Fail-safety and reliability - under no circumstances should your logging framework kill your application. In addition it would be most annoying to find that one log message that would help you de-cypher the problem your application ran into missing.</description></item><item><title>ApacheConEU - part 10</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconeu-part-1096/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2012 20:34:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconeu-part-1096/</guid><description>ApacheConEU - part 10 # In the next session Jukka introduced Tika - a toolkit for parsing content from files including a heuristics based component for guessing the file type: Based on file extension, magic and certain patterns in the file the file type can be guessed rather reliably.

not all mime types are registered with IANA, there are of course conflicting file extensions,

One major issue in schema design in the choice of key. Simplest recommendation is to make sure that keys are designed such that on reading data load will be evenly distributed accross all nodes to prevent region-server hot-spotting. General advise here are hashing or reversing urls.
When it comes to running your own HBase cluster make sure you know what is going on in the cluster at any point in time:</description></item><item><title>ApacheConEU - part 04</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconeu-part-0491/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2012 20:46:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apacheconeu-part-0491/</guid><description>ApacheConEU - part 04 # The second talk I went to was the one on the dev@hadoop.a.o insights given by Steve Loughran.

When dealing with remotes the git remote documentation is very useful.
When sharing your changes with others the git tutorial on sharing changes is very helpful.</description></item><item><title>Music in Berlin early June</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/music-in-berlin-early-june289/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2012 18:20:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/music-in-berlin-early-june289/</guid><description>Music in Berlin early June # A little bit of inspiration on what to do the weekend before and after Buzzwords in Berlin:

Improved Decision Tree performance and added support for regression problems
Reduced runtime of dot product between vectors - many algorithms in Mahout rely on that, so these performance improvements will affect anyone using them.</description></item><item><title>Clojure in Berlin</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/clojure-in-berlin140/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2012 00:01:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/clojure-in-berlin140/</guid><description>Clojure in Berlin # Though I had the chance to tinker with some Clojure code only briefly it&amp;rsquo;s programming model and the resulting compact programs do fascinate me.

Judging from the way some people become overly careful when discussing agile in general and Scrum in particular in my presence I seem to slowly have built up a reputation for being a strong proponent of these methods. Given the large number of flaky implementations as well as misunderstandings it seems to have become fashionable to blame Scrum for all badness and dismiss it altogether - up to the point where developers are proud to finally having abandoned Scrum completely - so that now they can work in iterations, accept new tasks only for upcoming but not for the current iteration, develop in a test-driven way, have daily sync meetings, mark tasks done only when they are delivered to and accepted by the customer, have regular “how to improve our work” meetings, estimate tasks in story points and only plan for as much work per iteration as was done in the past iteration</description></item><item><title>Reasons for you to visit Berlin Buzzwords</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/reasons-for-you-to-visit-berlin-buzzwords329/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2012 19:59:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/reasons-for-you-to-visit-berlin-buzzwords329/</guid><description>Reasons for you to visit Berlin Buzzwords # I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of several people who are not quite sure yet whether they should visit Berlin Buzzwords or not - in particular when having to travel far and cross 9 time zones to attend.

Well, it is not exactly that easy - however the comic actually is not so far from the truth either:
About two years ago, after having started Apache Mahout together with Grant Ingersoll, Karl Wettin and others, several Apache Hadoop user groups, meetups and get togethers started to pop up all around the world.</description></item><item><title>Going to Berlin Buzzwords</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/going-to-berlin-buzzwords213/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2010 08:46:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/going-to-berlin-buzzwords213/</guid><description>Going to Berlin Buzzwords # Meet me in two weeks at Berlin Buzzwords.

Most developers I know love puzzles - either those that involve dis-entangling metal rings, or those involving putting wooden pieces back into order, or even solving Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube:
Working on the schedule for Berlin Buzzwords, I noticed that coming up with a good schedule actually has a lot more in common with solving puzzles that one is usually aware of: First of all talks on similar or related topics should not take place at the same time.</description></item><item><title>Tierpark Berlin</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/tierpark-berlin410/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2010 19:36:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/tierpark-berlin410/</guid><description>Tierpark Berlin # I love taking fotos, like being outdoors and like animals.

Together with Simon Willnauer I ran the Lucene/Mahout booth at the expo.
So far the conference is still very small (about 400 visitors) compared to free software community events. However the focus was set to be more on professional users, accordingly several projects showed that free software can be used successfully for various business use cases.</description></item><item><title>Apache Con US Wrap Up</title><link>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-con-us-wrap-up24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2009 22:10:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isabel-drost.de/apache-con-us-wrap-up24/</guid><description>Apache Con US Wrap Up # some weeks ago I attended ApacheConUS09 in Oakland/ California.

An alternative are binary formats.
