# Apache Dinner after Berlin Buzzwords


Staying in town after Berlin Buzzwords? Interested in meeting with the Apache folks here? <a 
href="http://vafer.org/blog/">Torsten Curdt</a> kindly organises an Apache Dinner on Wednesday evening after Berlin 
Buzzwords. If you would like to participate, contact Torsten for details on when and where it will take 
place.<br><br>Though named Apache dinner, there is no need to be Apache committer or even member to participate: Being 
generally interested in Apache projects and in meeting the guys behind the project is totally sufficient.
