# Data Scientists - researchers' persectives


"Data scientist" as a term has caught quite some attention as of late (together with all the big data, scalability and 
cloud hype). Instead of re-hashing arguments seen in other sources I thought it might make more sense to link to a few 
of the thought provoking posts I came across recently.<br><br><ul><br><li>In his post <a 
href="http://blog.mikiobraun.de/2012/07/academia-industry-explore-build.html">Mikio Braun</a> analyses the factors 
motivating research in academia vs. engineering in the industry. Nice background material on why work looks so 
different in these fields. If you've never worked at academia this might be an interesting read to understand why 
research groups and research project look so different than your average open source project.<br><li>Some work on why 
<a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/925.html">data science really is just a sub-branch of 
statistics</a>.<br><li>An analysis on <a

scientist</a>, <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2011/10/04/data-science-tools-vs-craft/">tools and skills of a data

scientist should have</a> according to Matthew Hurst.<br><li>Also interesting: <a
