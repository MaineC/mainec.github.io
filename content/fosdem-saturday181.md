# FOSDEM - Saturday


<p>Day one at FOSDEM started with a very interesting and timely keynote by Eben Moglen: Starting with the example of 
Egypt he voted for de-centralized distributed and thus harder to take over communication systems. In terms of tooling 
we are already almost there. Most use cases like micro blogging, social networking and real time communications can 
already be implemented in a distributed, fail safe way. So instead of going for convenience it is time to think about 
digital independence from very few central providers.</p><p> I spent most of the morning in the data dev room. The 
schedule was packed with interesting presentations ranging from introductory overview talks on Hadoop to more in depth 
treatment of the machine learning framework Apache Mahout. With an analysis of the Wikileaks cables the schedule also 
included case studies on what use cases can be implemented by thourough data anlysis. The afternoon featured 
presentations on the background to more data analytics for better usability at Wikimedia as well as talks on buiding 
search applications.</p><p>In the lightning talks room a wide variety of projects was presented - in only ten minutes 
Pieter Hintjens explained the gist of using 0MQ for messaging. That talk included &quot;Hintjens law of concurrency: e 
= m * c^2, where e is effort needed to implement and maintain, m is mass - that is the amount of code written and c is 
complexity.</p><p>For me the day ended with a very interesting presentation by Matthias Kirschner/FSFE on one of their 
campaigns: pdfreaders.org has the very narrow and well scoped goal of getting links to unfree software off of 
governmental web pages. Using a really intuitive example they were able to convince officials of linking to their 
vendor neutral list of pdf readers: &quot;Just imagine a road in your city. At this road drivers will find a sign that 
tells them the road is well suited to be used by VW cars. Those cars can be obtained for test drive at the following 
address. Your government.&quot; As unthinkable as such as sign may be that same text is included in nearly all 
governmental web pages linking to the acrobat reader.</p><p>What made pdfreaders successful is the combined effort of 
volunteers, its very narrow and clear scope, it's scalability by nature: People were asked to submit &quot;broken&quot; 
web pages to a bug tracker, campaign participants would then go and send out paper letters to these institutions and 
mark the bugs fixed as soon as the links were changed. Letters were pre-written and well prepared. So all that was 
needed was money for toner, paper and stamps.</p><p>One final cute example of how that worked out can be seen at <a
