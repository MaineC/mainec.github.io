# A Get Together Checklist


Still on the list of potentially interesting books: <a href="http://gawande.com/the-checklist-manifesto">The Checklist 
Manifesto</a> - explaining why checklists can still be valuable - especially for complex problems and 
tasks.<br><br>Though not very complex, I chose to come up with a checklist for running a Hadoop Get Together in Berlin 
as an exercise. I'm trying to stick with advise provided by the <a 
href="http://www.projectcheck.org/checklist-for-checklists.html">Checklist for Checklists</a>.<br><br><b>Parties 
involved</b><br><br><ul><br><li>Find two to three speakers two months in advance.<br><li>Find a sponsor for the 
videos.<br></ul><br><b>Gathering information</b><br><br><ul><br><li>Double check time and date with all speakers and 
newthinking store.<br><li>Get name, title, abstract from the speakers.<br><li>Get logo and exact conditions from 
sponsor.<br></ul><br><b>Spreading the word</b><br><br><ul><br><li>Put together an announcement text including thanks to 
video and venue sponsors.<br><li>Publish the event on Upcoming.<br><li>Publish the event on Xing.<br><li>Augment the 
announcement text by the Xing event and Upcoming links.<br><li>Send a newsletter to the <a 
href="https://www.xing.com/net/prif07265x/informationretrieval/">Meetup Xing group</a>.<br><li>Send the text to the <a 
href="http://lists.isabel-drost.de/mailman/listinfo/hadoopberlin">Get Together mailing list</a>, and if appropriate to 
the Hadoop, HBase, katta, Lucene, Solr and Mahout mailing lists.<br><li>On event day send a reminder to the <a 
href="http://lists.isabel-drost.de/mailman/listinfo/hadoopberlin">Get Together mailing list</a><br><li>Create meetup 
intro slides including thanks for the sponsors, schedule, announcements of future events.<br></ul><br><b>During the 
meetup</b><br><br><ul><br><li>Mention newthinking bar during introduction.<br><li>Self-introduction of all 
participants.<br><li>Get mail addresses of future mailing list subscribers.<br><li>Keep presentations at 30 to 40 
minutes.<br><li>Get speakers' slides.<br></ul><br><b>After the event</b><br><br><ul><br><li>Publish talks' 
slides.<br><li>Publish links to videos.<br></ul><br><br>The more meetups you have run the larger the chance of the main 
organiser getting sick the day the meetup takes place. To avoid having to re-schedule the event make sure there are 
people that are capable and willing to take over moderation.
