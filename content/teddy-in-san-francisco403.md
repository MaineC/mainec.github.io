# Teddy in San Francisco


<p>Before attending O'Reilly Strata there were a few days left to adjust to the different time zone, meet up with 
friends and generally spend some days in the Greater San Francisco area. As was to be expected, those were way to few 
days. The weekend was a bit rainy, still packed with visiting China town right after the plane had landed and spending 
some time at ... Finally was taken out to Bucks - the restaurant among software engineers generally known for being the 
place where VC deals are being made.</p><p align="center"> <img

red wood trees - it's so great driving just a few minutes out of the city and arriving in an area that looks like being 
set up for a fairy tale movie. With all the mist and with sun coming out here and there the area looked even more 
bewitched. </p><p align="center"> <img src="http://isabel-drost.de/Bilder/wordpress/usa_2011_2.png" width="600" 
/></p><p>On Monday sun finally arrived in the bay - as a result a ferry trip to Sausolito seemed like the optimal thing 
to do. Unfortunately not enough time to rent a bike an to the &quot;ride the bridge&quot; tour - or get a kajak to go 
out into the bay. Maybe next time though.</p><p align="center"> <img

showed me some pieces of chocolate someone in the US made him adicted to - now it's not just the tasty swiss one but 
also the Berkley one I have to find a shop for in Berlin ;) </p><p align="center"> <img
