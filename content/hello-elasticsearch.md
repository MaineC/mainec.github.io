# Hello elasticsearch


First of all a disclaimer: I had a little bit of time left during the last few
weeks. As a result my blog migrated from dynamic wordpress content to statically
hosted pages. If anything looks odd, in case you find any encoding issues, if
you miss specific functionality - please do let me know. I'll switch from this
beta url back to the old sub-domain in a week or so unless there are major
complaints.
<br><br>
Today was my first day in a new office. Some of you may have heard it already:
As of today I'm working for Elasticsearch. Apparently the majority of devs
here are using Apple hardware so with a little help from <a
href="http://randomtutor.blogspot.de/2013/02/installing-ubuntu-1304-on-retina.html">Random
Tutor</a> and <a href="http://thilo-fromm.de">my husband</a> I got my new
machine equipped to boot Linux in parallel yesterday.
<br><br>
As a result what was left for today was reading lots of documentation, getting
accustomed to the internal tools, attending my first daily standup, forking the
repository, starting to take a closer look at the source code, issue tracker and
design docs. Now looking forward to both - the elasticsearch training in
December and meeting other elasticsearch people over at FOSDEM next year: Find
me at their booth there.

Thanks for the warm welcome everyone!
