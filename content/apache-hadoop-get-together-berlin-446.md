a><br><br><br>Talks scheduled thus far: <br><br>Speaker: <br>Dragan Milosevic <br><br>Session: <br>Robust Communication 
Mechanisms in zanox Reporting Systems <br><br>It happened an annoying number of times that we wanted to improve only 
one particular component in our distributed reporting system, but often had to update almost everything due to the RPC 
version-mismatch, which occurred in a communication between the updated component and the rest of our system. To 
mitigate this problem and to significantly simplify the integration of new components, we extended the used RPC 
protocol to perform a version handshake before the actual communication starts. This RPC extension is accompanied with 
serialisation/deserialization methods, which are downward compatible due to being able to successfully deserialise any 
<br>serialised older version of exchanged objects. Putting together these extensions makes it possible for us to 
successfully operate multiple versions of frontend and backend components, and to have the power to autonomously decide 
what and when should be updated/improved in our distributed reporting system. <br><br><br>Two other talks are planned 
and I will provide you with further information soon. <br><br>A big Thank You goes to Immobilien Scout GmbH for 
providing the venue at no cost for our event and for sponsoring the videotaping of the presentations. <br><br>Looking 
forward to seeing you in Berlin, <br><br>David
