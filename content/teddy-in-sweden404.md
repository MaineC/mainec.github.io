# Teddy in Sweden


Some picture taken all the way up in northern Sweden:<br><br><img 
src="http://isabel-drost.de/Bilder/wordpress/sweden_2012.jpeg"/><br><br>Those picture were taken mid-June. That means 
what looks like Teddy sitting in the afternoon sun actually was taken 20min before midnight some 40km south of the 
arctic circle at <a href="http://www.frevisoren.se/">Camp Frevis√∂ren</a> - an incredible spot to start the day on a 
canoo:<br><br><iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"

make sure to stop by at <a href="http://hulkoff.se/">Hulkoff.se</a>. We got the tip only a few days before we left 
asking a Swedish friend where to go to see midsummer. Though he is not from that very area he recommended going there 
if we get a chance - and that turned out a beautiful idea: Not only is the restaurant/ conference venue nicely located 
just a few km before Finland - they also serve most tasty meals!<br><br>PS: In case you're wondering what that monkey 
on the pictures is - it's Teddy's new friend "Herr Nielson" - the little squirrel monkey that is <a 
href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herr_Nilsson#Persongalleri">the best friend of the strongest girl in the world</a>.
