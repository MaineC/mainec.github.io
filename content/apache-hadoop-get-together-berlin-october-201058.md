height="100"/><br><br></td></tr></table><br>As always there will be slots of 30min each for talks on your Hadoop topic. 
After each talk there will be a lot time to discuss. You can order drinks directly at the bar in the newthinking store. 
If you like, you can order pizza. We will go to Cafe Aufsturz after the event for some beer and something to 
eat.<br><br>Talks scheduled so far:<br><br><b>Max Heimel:</b> "Hidden Markov Models for Apache Mahout"<br><br>Abstract: 
In this talk I will present and discuss an implementation of a powerful statistical tool called Hidden Markov Models 
for the Apache Mahout project. Hidden Markov models allow to mathematically deduce the structure of an underlying - and 
unobservable - process based on the structure of the produced data. Hidden Markov Models are thus frequently applied in 
pattern recognition to deduce structures that are not directly observable. Examples for applications of Hidden Markov 
Models include the recognition of syllables in speech recordings, handwritten letter recognition and part-of-speech 
tagging.<br><br><b>Sebastian Schelter:</b> Distributed Itembased Collaborative Filtering with Apache 
Mahout"<br><br>Abstract: Recommendation Mining helps users find items they like. A very popular way to implement this 
is by using Collaborative Filtering. This talk will give an introduction to an approach called Itembased Collaborative 
Filtering and explain Mahout's Map/Reduce based implementation of it.<br><br><iframe width="425" height="350"
