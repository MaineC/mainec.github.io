# FrOSCon 2012


On August 25th/26th the <a href="http://www.froscon.de/en/home/">Free and Open Source Conference (FrOSCon)</a> will 
again kick off in Sankt Augustin/ Germany. <br><br><a href="http://froscon.de"><img 
src="http://www.froscon.de/typo3temp/pics/f64e78d68d.jpg" width=300/></a><br><br>The event is completely community 
organised, hosted by the FH Sankt Augustin. It covers a broad range of free software topics like Arduino 
microcontrollers, git goodies, politics, strace, open nebula, wireshark and others.<br><br>Three highlights that are on 
my schedule:<br><br><ul><br><li>I'll make sure I do not miss Thilo Fromm's presentation <a 
href="http://programm.froscon.de/2012/events/950.html">on building a platform project on top of Open 
Embedded</a>.<br><li>Being an <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">FSFE fellow</a> I'll hang out for a bit at their 
booth. <br><li>On Saturday there's the traditional FrOSCon BBQ - most likely I'll go there. Would be great to also meet 
some other Apache people there.<br></ul><br><br>Looking forward to interesting talks and discussions at FrOSCon.
