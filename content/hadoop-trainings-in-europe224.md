# Hadoop trainings in Europe


Recently I received this mail from Christophe Bisciglia on Cloudera Hadoop trainings. Thought it might be interesting 
to the Hadoop Berlin community: <br><br><br><br><blockquote><br>Hadoop Fans,<br><br>Over the next year, you'll see new 
options for Hadoop training and<br>certification from Cloudera. One of the first things you'll see will<br>be live 
sessions outside the US, tentatively planned for the April /<br>May time frame.<br><br>We've seen strong interest in 
Hadoop on all of our international<br>trips, so we'd like to ask for community input as we decide exactly<br>which 
cities to visit next. For cities we come to, we'll offer our 3<br>day developer training + certification, and with 
sufficient interest,<br>we may also include a 1 day training + certification program for<br>system 
administrators.<br><br>If you are interested in attending one or both of these sessions,<br>please fill out a brief 
survey (link below). If you're using Hadoop at<br>work, and it's time to train more of your team, you can let us 
know<br>how large of a group you have. Survey responses aren't a commitment to<br>attend, but we may reach out to 
respondents before we schedule a<br>session to get a better understanding of actual attendance.<br><br>You can fill out 
survey here: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MKGZHG9<br><br>If you have any trouble with the survey, or are interested in 
a<br>private training session, please don't hesitate to reach out 
directly.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Christophe<br></blockquote><br><br>
