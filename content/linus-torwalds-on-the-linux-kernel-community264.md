# Linus Torwalds on the Linux kernel community


A few days ago, Linus send <a 
href="http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&id=110618&threadid=110549&roomid=2">a very 
interesting mail</a> on why he considers C the programming language that is most suitable for the Linux kernel. Despite 
the language specific arguments, the text contains quite a few insights on how the Linux kernel community works and 
communicates that might be interesting to non-kernel-hackers as well:<br><br><blockquote><br>People working for free 
still doesn't mean that it's fine<br>to make the work take more effort - people still work for<br>other compensation, 
and not feeling excessively<br>frustrated about the tools (including language) and getting<br>productive work done is a 
big issue.<br></blockquote><br><br>When attending Open Source conferences or contributing to free software projects I 
have made the exact same observation multiple times: Developers may not get money out of contributing to a free 
software project (though often they may do) there are other rewards that keep them working on any particular project: 
Learning from excellent peers usually is one reason. Being able to work on a topic you like at any time that suits you 
may be another one. <br><br>Developing free software is largely different than your usual professional work: People 
work voluntarily, putting as much effort into the code as is needed for them to be satisfied with the end-result. There 
may not be any deadlines fixed by contracts, still developers honour release cycles with the goal of providing a 
reliable product to their end users.<br><br>In the end it all boils down to being passionate about what you work on. To 
be involved in any open source project takes a huge amount of energy - but usually you get more in return than you are 
even able to invest. However if passion is a pre requisite to working on any free software this also means it is 
extremely hard to pay developers to work on any free software project: You just cannot buy passion or love for 
money.<br><br><blockquote><br>But the thing is, "lines of code" isn't even remotely close<br>to being a measure of 
productivity, or even the gating<br>issue. The gating issue in any large project is pretty much<br>all about (a) 
getting the top people and (b) communication.<br></blockquote><br><br>Can only quote that - totally agree with the 
analysis. This applies to any software project - free or proprietary. So if you own a software development business: 
What is your strategy for getting the top people and facilitating communication in your company? What is your measure 
of productivity?
