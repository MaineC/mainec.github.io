# White Christmas


Christmas brought "a little surprise" to Germany last night:<br><br><center><br><img

in about 20) of snow - that is a white christmas everyone had been looking forward to. Just one question: Where to put 
all that snow when digging out my car? ;)<br><br><center><br><img

streets are all white but well drivable. Other than that lots of time for enjoying the white weather. I'll probably use 
the time off to to go out with a sledge tomorrow.
