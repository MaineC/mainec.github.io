# Note to self - link to 3D maps


After searching for the link the third time today - just in case I happen to be again looking for Nokia's 3d maps: <a 
href="http://maps3d.svc.nokia.com/webgl/index.html">http://maps3d.svc.nokia.com/webgl/index.html</a> is the non-plugin 
link that works in Firefox.
