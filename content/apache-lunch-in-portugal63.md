# Apache Lunch in Portugal


Just read on the Apache community mailing list that inspired by our Apache Dinner Berlin people in Porto are organising 
an Apache Lunch event. As with the dinner here in Berlin, anyone who is interested in Apache is welcome to join - no 
need to be a committer or even ASF member ;) <br><br>If you are living close to Porto, or always wanted to visit the 
city - after all it's  a very beautiful place, there is a beach close by, there are many tasty restaurants - don't 
hesitate to get in touch with the organisers:<br><br><blockquote><br>My xmpp is:  fdmanana@gmail.com. Feel free to add 
me.<br><br>People interested in coming, let us known your availability during the 2<br>first weeks of 
August.<br></blockquote><br><br>So, if you are interested in Apache head over to Filipe - I'd love to be there, however 
my summer vacation ended one week ago. Wish you guys a lot of fun.
