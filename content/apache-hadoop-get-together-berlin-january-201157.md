each for talks on your Hadoop topic. After each talk there will be a lot time to discuss. We head over to a bar after 
the event for some beer and something to eat.<br><br>Talks scheduled so far:<br><br>Simon Willnauer: "Lucene 4 - 
Revisiting problems for speed"<br><br>Abstract: This talk presents a brief case study of long standing problems in 
Lucene and how they have been approached to gain sizable performance improvements. Each of the presented problems will 
have brief introduction, implemented solution and resulting performance improvements. This talk might be interesting 
even for non-lucene folks. <br><br>Josh Devins: "Title: Hadoop at Nokia"<br>Abstract: In this talk, Josh will outline 
some of the ways in which Nokia is using Hadoop. We will start by having a quick look at the practical side of getting 
started with Hadoop and outline cluster hardware and configuration and management with tools like Puppet. Next we'll 
dive head first into how Hadoop and its' ecosystem are being utilized on a daily basis to perform business analytics, 
drive machine learning and help build data-driven products. We will also touch on how we go about collecting metrics 
from dozens of applications distributed in multiple data centers around the world. An open Q&A session will 
follow.<br><br>Paolo Negri: "The order of magnitude challenge: from 100K daily users to 1M "<br>Abstract: "Social games 
backends share many aspects of normal web applications, but exasperate scaling problems, follow this talk to see how we 
evolved and brought a plain ruby on rails app to sustain 5000 reqs/sec, moved part of our data from sql to nosql to 
reach 5 millions queries per minute and see what we learned from this experience."<br><br>Please do indicate on <a
