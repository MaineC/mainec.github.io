# Slides available


Yesterday evening the Autumn Hadoop Get Together took place in Berlin. The meetup this time focussed mainly on latest 
developments at Apache Mahout. The meetup was kindly sponsored by JTeam, providing video taping of the presentations as 
well as for free drinks. Thanks a lot for that.<br><br>After the meetup the group went over to Cafe Aufsturz for 
drinks, food and lots of interesting discussions - I left them there as I still have to get rid of a persistent cold. 
Hope you guys had fun!<br><br>The two speakers were so kind to provide the slides:<br><br><ul><br><li><a
