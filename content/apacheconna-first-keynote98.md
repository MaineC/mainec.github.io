# ApacheConNA: First keynote


<P><br>All three ApacheCon keynotes were focussed around the general theme of open<br>source communities. The first on 
given by Theo had very good advise to the<br>engineer not only striving to work on open source software but become 
an<br>excellent software developer:<br><br><P><br><br><UL><br><LI>Be loyal to the problem instead of to the code: You 
shouldn't be<br>addicted to any particular programming language or framework and refuse to work<br>and get familiar 
with others. Avoid high specialisation and seek cross<br>fertilisation. Instead of addiction to your tooling you should 
seek to<br>diversify your toolset to use the best for your current problem.<br></LI><br><LI>Work towards becoming a 
generalist: Understand your stack top to bottom -<br>starting with your code, potentially passing the VM it runs in up 
down to the<br>hardware layer. Do the same to requirements you are exposed to: Being 1s old<br>may be just good enough 
to be ``always current'' when thinking of a news<br>serving web site. Try to understand the real problem that underpins 
a certain<br>technical requirement that is being brought up to you. This deep understanding<br>of how your system works 
can make the difference in fixing a production issue<br>in three days instead of twelve 
weeks.<br></LI><br></UL><br><br><P><br>The last point is particularly interesting for those aiming to write 
scalable<br>code: Software and frameworks today are intended to make development easier -<br>with high probability they 
will break when running at the edge.<br><br><P><br>What is unique about the ASF is the great opportunity to meet people 
with<br>experience in many different technologies. In addition there is an unparalleled<br>level of trust in a 
community as diverse as the ASF. One open question that<br>remains is how to leverage this potential successfully 
within the foundation.<br><br><P><br>
