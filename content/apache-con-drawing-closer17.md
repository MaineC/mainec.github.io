# Apache Con drawing closer


By November I will be traveling to Oakland - for me it is the first Apache Con US ever. And the first Apache Con I will 
be giving a talk in one of the main tracks:<br><br><img 
src="http://us.apachecon.com/page_attachments/0000/0223/468x60_speaker.gif"><br><br>I will be <a 
href="http://us.apachecon.com/c/acus2009/sessions/333">presenting Apache Mahout</a>, give an overview of the project, 
of our current status and explain which problems can be solved with the current implementation. The talks will conclude 
with an outlook to upcoming tasks and features our users can expect in the near future.<br><br>There is great news 
already: First commercial users like <a href="http://blog.mippin.com/2009/09/may-we-recommend.html">Mippin</a> are 
explaining their experiences with Mahout.<br><br>Currently, I am looking forward to meeting several Mahout (and Lucene, 
Hadoop, Solr, ...) committers there. I met some at Apache Con EU already, but it's always nice to talk to people in 
person who before one only knew from mailing lists. Of course I am also looking forward to having time to review and 
write code. Hope to see you there.<br><br>Update: Flights booked.
