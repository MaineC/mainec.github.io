# Apache Dinner - April 2010


Today, the April Apache Dinner took place in Berlin. We met at <a 
href="http://www.qype.com/place/260473-Sadhu-Berlin">Sadhu</a> - an Indian restaurant in Berlin X-Berg. We were six 
people: Lars Trieloff from Day Software, Simon Willnauer and Vera from Lucene, Torsten Curdt - currently Freelancer and 
Daniel Naber from Lucene as well.<br><br>With great food, nice discussions and a first glimpse on the submissions for 
<a href="http://berlinbuzzwords.de">Berlin Buzzwords</a> it quickly got later and later :)<br><br>If you are Apache 
Committer/Member yourself or are simply interested in learning more about this crazy bunch of software developers 
meeting each month in a different restaurant, please contact Torsten for more information on the meetup - and to be 
included on the next meetup schedule. As we are by far more than ten people interested in delicious food and meeting 
other "indians in Berlin", I created a <a href="http://lists.isabel-drost.de/mailman/listinfo/apachedinner">Dinner 
mailing list</a> - please join, if you plan to take part in the dinner in the near future.
