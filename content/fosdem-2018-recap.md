# FOSDEM 2018 - recap


Too crowded, too many queues, too little space - but also lots of friendly people, Belgian waffles, ice cream, an ASF 
dinner with grey beards and new people, a busy ASF booth, bumping into friends every few steps, meeting humans you see 
only online for an entire year or more: For me, that's the gist of this year's FOSDEM.

Note: German version of the article including images appeared in <a

<br><br>
To my knowledge FOSDEM is the biggest gathering of free software people in Europe at least. It's free of charge, kindly 
hosted by <a href="http://www.ulb.ac.be">ULB</a>, organised by a large group of volunteers. Every year early February 
the FOSS community meets for two one weekend in Brussels to discuss all sorts of aspects of Free and Open Source 
Software Development - including community, legal, business and policy aspects. The event features more than 600 talks 
as well as several dozen booths by FOSS projects and FOSS friendly companies. There's several FOSDEM fringe events 
surrounding the event that are not located on campus. If you go to any random bar or restaurant in Brussels that 
weekend you are bound to bump into FOSDEM people.

Fortunately for those not lucky enough to have made it to the event, video recordings (unfortunately in varying 
quality) are available online at <a href="http://video.fosdem.org">video.fosdem.org</a>. Some highlights you might want 
to watch:

Spectre, and other hardware attacks</a> by Jon Masters in case you want to understand what the Meltdown and Spectre and 
the underlying causes really mean for computer security.
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/community_passing_the_batton_foss_leadership/">Passing the Baton: 
Succession Planning for FOSS leadership</a> by VM (Vicky) Brasseur on why you should build hand over into your open 
source project before it's too late including some hints on how to best do that.
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/too_young_to_rock_n_roll/"> Too young to Rock'n'Roll</a> by Dominik 
George and Niels Hradek on what legal hurdles minors encounter when trying to contribute to open source projects.
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/state_openjdk/">State of OpenJDK</a> by Mark Reinhold if you're 
interested in the state of OpenJDK, both in terms of community as well as in terms of technical challenges ahead.
</ul>

One highlight for me personally this year: I cannot help but believe that I met way more faces from The Apache Software 
Foundation than at any other FOSDEM before. The booth was crowded at all times - Sharan Foga did a great job explaining 
The ASF to people. Also it's great to hear The ASF mentioned in several talks as one of the initiatives to look at to 
understand how to run open source projects in a sustainable fashion with an eye on longevity. It was helpful to have at 
least two current Apache board members (Bertrand Delacretaz as well as Rich Bowen) on site to help answer tricky 
questions. Last but not least it was lovely meeting several of the Apache Grey Beards (TM) for an Apache Dinner on 
Saturday evening. Luckily co-located with the FOSDEM HPC speaker dinner - which took a calendar conflict out of the 
Apache HPC people's calendar :)

<br><br>
Me personally, I hope to see many more ASF people later this year in Berlin for FOSS Backstage - the advertisement sign 
that was located at the FOSDEM ASF booth last weekend already made it here, will you follow?
