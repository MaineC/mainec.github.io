# DIMA @ TU Berlin


On Friday, the 24th of April Prof. Volker Markl organised a Welcome Workshop at TU Berlin. The day started with an 
introduction by the Dekan of the faculty. First talk was given by Rudolf Bayer on the topic "From B-Trees to UB-Trees". 
Second presentation was by Guy Lohman on "LEO, DB2's Learning Optimizer".<br><br>After the coffee break, Volker Markl 
gave an introduction to his selected research field, outstanding tasks and the way he is going to accomplish his goals. 
Seems like scalability is playing a major role in his tasks. Interestingly Hadoop was chosen as an infrastructure 
basis.<br><br>In his talk Volker Markl announced the newly started <a
