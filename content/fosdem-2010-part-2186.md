# FOSDEM 2010 - part 2


The event itself featured 306 talks - so pretty hard to choose what to watch on two days. This time, not only the main 
tracks were awesome, but also several dev rooms featured very interesting talks by well known FOSS 
developers.<br><br>Saturday started with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m9FFjPlowk">FOSDEM birthday 
dance</a> done by all attendees. The first keynote speaker Brooks Davis explained his experiences promoting open source 
methods at a large company. After that <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/">Richard Clayton</a> gave an amazing 
talk on the evil on the internet. He explained not only how phishing works on a technical level but also included an 
explanation of the economics behind these attacks, explained how the money flow from victims to attackers 
works.<br><br>On the afternoon Bernard Li gave an introduction to the cluster monitoring tool Ganglia. Directly after 
that Lindsay Holmwood gave an overview of the monitoring and notification tools flapjack and 
cucumber-nagios.<br><br>The evening was filled with the speakers dinner. Thanks for the organisers for providing that. 
We had a really nice evening together with some of the organisers, <a
