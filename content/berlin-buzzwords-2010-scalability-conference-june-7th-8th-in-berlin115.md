# Berlin Buzzwords 2010 - Scalability conference June 7th/ 8th in Berlin


The Berlin Buzzwords schedule was published a few days ago. There are tracks specific to the three tags search, store 
and scale. We have a fantastic mixture of developers and users of open source software projects that make scaling data 
processing today possible.<br><br>There is Steve Loughran, Aaron Kimball and Stefan Groschupf from the Apache Hadoop 
community. We have Grant Ingersoll, Robert Muir and the "Generics Policeman" Uwe Schindler from the Lucene 
community.<br><br>For those interested in NoSQL databases there is Mathias Stearn from MongoDB, Jan Lehnardt from 
CouchDB and Eric Evans, the guy who coined the term NoSQL one year ago.<br><br><a

are having a <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBerlinBuzzwords">Berlin Buzzwords Barcamp</a> in town. In addition, 
directly after the conference, Cloudera will be hosting <a 
href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/635728481/buzzwords/1022889453">Apache Hadoop trainings</a> - registration is 
separate from Berlin Buzzwords.<br><br>So just in case you need a good excuse for a long term trip to Berlin: You can 
spend the weekend in town, attend the Barcamp on Sunday evening, visit Berlin Buzzwords on Monday and Tuesday. The rest 
of the week could be used to take part in Apache Hadoop trainings. Finally you have one weekend left for a city 
tour.<br><br>Thanks to Jan Lehnardt, Simon Willnauer and newthinking communications for co-organising the event.
