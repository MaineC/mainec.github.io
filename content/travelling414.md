# Travelling


Currently on my way back from a series of conferences in the past three weeks in the IC from Schiphol. After three 
weeks of conferences, lots of new input and lots of interesting projects I learned about it is finally time to head 
back and put the stuff I have learned to good use.<br><br><iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0"

conferences I got far more input on interesting projects than I can expect to ever get applied in on a daily basis. 
Still it is always inspiring to meet with other developers in the same field â€“ or even quite different fields and learn 
more on what projects they are working on, how they solve various problems.<br><br>A huge Thank You goes to the DICODE 
EU research project for sponsoring the Apache Con and Devoxx trips, another Thanks to Sapo.pt for inviting me to Lisbon 
and covering travel expenses. A special thank you to the assistant at neofonie who made travel arrangements for Atlanta 
and Antwerp: It all worked without problems even up to me having a power outlet in the train that is finally taking me 
back.
