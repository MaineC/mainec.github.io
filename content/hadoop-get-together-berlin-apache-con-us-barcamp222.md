# Hadoop Get Together Berlin @ Apache Con US Barcamp


This is my first real day at ApacheCon US 2009. I arrived yesterday afternoon, was kept awake by three Lucene 
committers until midnight: "Otherwise you will have a very bad jetlag"... Admittedly it did work out: I slept like a 
baby until about 08:00a.m. the next morning and am not that tired today.<br><br>Today Hackthon, Trainings and barcamp 
Apache happen in parallel. Ross Gardler tricked me into doing a presentation on my experiences on doing local user 
meetups. I put the <a href="http://isabel-drost.de/hadoop/slides/barcamp09us.pdf">slides</a> online.<br><br>The general 
consent was, that it is actually not that hard to do such a meetup - at least if you are have someone locally to help 
organizing or do it in a town you know very well. There are ways to get support from the ASF for doing such meetups - 
people help you get speakers, talk to potential sponsors or find a location. In my experience if doing the event in 
your hometown, finding a location is not that hard: Either you are lucky having someone like newthinking store around. 
Or you can contact you local university or even your employer to find some conference room that you can use for 
free.<br><br>Getting the first two to three meetups up and running - especially finding speakers - is hard. However you 
should be able to benefit from being part of an Apache project already and probably know your community and know who 
would be willing to speak at one of those meetups. Once the meetup is well established, it should be possible to find 
sponsors to pay for video taping, free beer and pizza.<br><br>Keep in mind that having a fixed schedule ready in 
advance helps to attract people - it's always good to know why one should travel to the meetup by train or plane. Don't 
forget to plan for time for socializing after the event - having some beer and maybe food together makes it easy for 
people to connect after the meetup.
