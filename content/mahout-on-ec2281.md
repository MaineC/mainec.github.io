# Mahout on EC2


Amazon released Elastic Map Reduce only a few weeks ago. EMR is based on a hosted Hadoop environment and offers 
machines to run map reduce jobs against data in S3 on demand.<br><br>Last week Stephen Green has spent quite some 
effort to get Mahout running on EMR. Thanks to his work Mahout is running on EMR since last Thursday night. Read the 
weblog of <a href="http://www.thecepblog.com/2009/04/19/kmeans-clustering-now-running-on-elastic-mapreduce/">Tim 
Bass</a> for further information.
