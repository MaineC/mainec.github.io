# Apache Hadoop Get Together - Hand over 


Apache Hadoop receives lots of attention from large US corporations who are using the project to scale their data 
processing pipelines:<br><br>“Facebook uses Hadoop and Hive extensively to process large data sets. [...]” (Ashish 
Thusoo, Engineering Manager at Facebook), "Hadoop is a key ingredient in allowing LinkedIn to build many of our most 
computationally difficult features [...]" (Jay Kreps, Principal Engineer, LinkedIn), "Hadoop enables [Twitter] to 
store, process, and derive insights from our data in ways that wouldn't  otherwise be possible. [...]" (Kevin Weil, 
Analytics Lead, Twitter). Found on <a 
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/07/live_from_hadoop_summit_what_the_leaders_are_saying/">Yahoo 
developer blog</a>.<br><br> However the system's use is not limited to large corporations only: With 101tec, Zanox, 
nugg.ad, nurago also local German players are using the project to enable new applications. Add components like Lucene, 
Redis, CouchDB, HBase and UIMA to the mix and you end up with a set of majour open source components that allow  
developers to rapidly develop systems that until a few years ago were possible only either in Google-like companies or 
in research.<br> <br>The Berlin Apache Hadoop Get Together started in 2008 allowed to learn more on how the average 
local company leveraged this software. It is a platform to get in touch informally, exchange knowledge and best 
practices across corporate boundaries.<br> <br>After three years of organising that event it is time to hand it over to 
new caring hands: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=9861942&locale=en_US&trk=tyah">David Obermann</a> 
from <a href="http://idealo.com/">Idealo</a> kindly volunteered to take over organisation. He is a long-term attendee 
of the event and will continue it in the roughly the same spirit as before: Technical talks on success stories by 
users, new features by developers - not solely restricted to Hadoop only but also taking into account related 
projects.<br><br>A huge Thank You for taking up the work of co-ordinating, finding a venue and a sponsor for the videos 
goes to David! If any of you attending the event think that you have an interesting story to share, would like to 
support the event financially or just help out please get in touch with David.<br><br>Looking forward to the next 
Apache Hadoop Get Together Berlin. Watch this space for updates on when and where it will take place.
