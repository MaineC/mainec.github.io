# I love FS 2014


 It's that day of the year again: Time to buy flowers and chocolate for your
 beloved one. However as with previous years, FSFE wants you to put the day to
 good use to also celebrate your favourite free software developer (you know,
 the
 people who get way more bug reports and complaints than positive feedback):

 style="border: 0 !important;" alt="I love Free Software!"></a></center>

 So here's to the people over at Apache, Debian, Eclipse, Elasticsearch, Linux,
 ZeroMQ
 and the many other projects that make my life easier: Happy I love Free
 Software Day -
 get yourself celebrated!
