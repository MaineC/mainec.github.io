# Scrum Day Düsseldorf


On 01. to 02. December the <a href="http://www.scrum-day.de/speaker/index.html">Scrum Day</a> is going to take place in 
Düsseldorf.<br><br>If you are working in a non-Scrum company and would like to use agile methods both for development 
and management, I would like to recommend going to the talk by <a 
href="http://www.scrum-day.de/speaker/7082429c980e45404.html">Thilo Fromm: Scrum in a waterfall</a>. He explains how he 
transformed his project to an agile way in a waterfall environment.
