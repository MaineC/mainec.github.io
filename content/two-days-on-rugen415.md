# Two days on Rügen


Below: Sunday morning on Rügen, feet in the East Sea. It looks colder than it actually was: Air was about 17 °C, but 
the water was fine. At least for my feet.<br><br><img

spare tickets for the Störtebecker Festspiele last Thursday and caused us to drive to isle Rügen yesterday afternoon.
