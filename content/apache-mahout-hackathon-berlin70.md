# Apache Mahout Hackathon Berlin


Early next year - on February 19th/20th to be more precise - the first Apache Mahout Hackathon is scheduled to take 
place at <a href="http://www.c-base.org/">c-base</a>.  The Hackathon will take one weekend. There will be plenty of 
time to hack on your favourite Mahout issue, to get in touch with two of the Mahout committers and get your machine 
learning project off the ground.<br><br>Please contact <a href="mailto:isabel@apache.org">isabel@apache.org</a> if you
