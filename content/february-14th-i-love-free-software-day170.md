# February 14th: "I love free software day"


This year <a href="http://www.fsfe.org">FSFE</a> is once again running their <a href="http://ilovefs.org">I love free 
software</a> campaign on February 14th: The goal they put up is to have more love reports, hugs and Thank You messages 
sent out than bug reports filed against projects.<br><br>They have put online <a 
href="http://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20120209-01.en.html">a few ideas</a> on what to do that day. I'd like to add one 
additional option: If you are using any free software and you feel the urgent need to file a bug report on that day, 
use the opportunity to submit a patch as well: Make sure to not only describe what is going wrong but add a patch that 
contains a test to show the issue and a code modification that fixes the issue, is compatible with the project's coding 
guidelines, doesn't break anything else in the project. Any other contribution (documentation, increasing test 
coverage, help to other users) welcome as well of course.
