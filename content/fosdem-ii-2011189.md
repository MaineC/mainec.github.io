# FOSDEM II 2011


It's already sort of a nice little tradition for me to spend the first weekend in February in Brussels for FOSDEM. This 
year I am particulary happy that there will be a Data Analytics Dev Room at FOSDEM. A huge Thanks to @ogrisel and 
@nmaillot who have done most of the heavy lifting of getting the schedule in place.<br><br><a

Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting" /></a><br><br>Looking forward to an interesting Cloud Track, to 
meeting Peter Hintjens who is going to give a talk on 0MQ, the DevOps presentation and lots of very interesting 
DevRooms. Looks like again it's going to be tough to decide on which presentations to go to at any one time. <br>
