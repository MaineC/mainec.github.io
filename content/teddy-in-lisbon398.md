# Teddy in Lisbon


After Apache Con I spent a few days in Lisbon for Codebits. The conference is not developers-only. It is more of a 
mixture of hacking event, conference, exhibition. Though the location was not optimal for giving presentations (large 
exhibition hall with now a rather noisy presentation area) the whole event brought quite an interesting mixture of 
people together in one place in the capital of Portugal.<br><br><img

however that was just for recreating and vacation. So this time around I was quite happy to get the chance of seeing 
some part of the local culture that otherwise I would probably never have gotten access to. Having some loose ties to 
the Berlin hackers community, to the free software people in Europe but also to pragmatic open source developers what 
was most astonishing to me was to see the comparably huge amount of systems running Microsoft Windows used by codebits 
attendees. Talking a bit with locals it seemed like using free software for development is not all that unusual in 
Portugal, however people tend to wait for problems getting fixed instead of getting involved and actively contributing 
back.
