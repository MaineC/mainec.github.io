goal of delivering scalable machine learning algorithm implementations under the Apache license. 
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0<br><br>Mahout is a machine learning library meant to scale: Scale in terms 
of community to support anyone interested in using machine learning. Scale in terms of business by providing the 
library under a commercially friendly, free software license. Scale in terms of computation to the size of data we 
manage today.<br><br>Built on top of the powerful map/reduce paradigm of the Apache Hadoop project, Mahout lets you 
solve popular machine learning problem settings like clustering, collaborative filtering and classification<br>over 
Terabytes of data over thousands of computers.<br><br>Implemented with scalability in mind the latest release brings 
many performance optimizations so that even in a single node setup the library performs well.<br><br>The complete
