# JAX: Project Nashorn


The last talk I went to was on project Nashorn - demonstrating the capability<br>to run dynamic languages on the JVM by 
writing a JavaScript implementation as a<br>proof of concept that is fully ECMA compliant and still performs better 
than<br>Mozilla's project Rhino.<br><br><P><br>It was nice to see Lisp, created in 1962, referenced as being the 
first<br>language that featured a JIT compiler as well as garbage collection. It was<br>also good to see Smalltalk 
referenced as pioneering class libraries, visual GUI<br>driven IDEs and bytecode.<br><br><P><br>As such Java 
essentially stands on the shoulders of giants. Now dynamic<br>language writers can themselves use the JVM to boost 
their productivity by<br>profiting from the VM's memory management, JIT optimisations, native threading.<br>The result 
could be a smaller code base and more time to concentrate on<br>interesting language features (of course another result 
would be that the JVM<br>becomes interesting not only for Java developers but also to people who want to<br>use dynamic 
languages instead).<br><br><P><br>The projects invoke dynamic as well as the DaVinci machine are both 
interesting<br>areas for people to follow who are interested in running dynamic languages on<br>the JVM.<br>
