# FOSDEM 2010 - part 1


Four years ago I was working in Saarbr&uuml;cken. From there it is a very short ride over to FOSDEM (little more than 
300km). So I decided - hey, why not stay there for a weekend. I found a very nice <a 
href="http://www.rovignon.com">Brussels bed and breakfast hotel</a> called Rovignon - featuring not only comfortable 
rooms at reasonable prizes but also cats in the house.<br><br>Back then, I barely knew anyone at the conference. 
However the lineup of speakers including <a href="http://xmpp.org/xsf/people/stpeter.shtml">St Peter</a> from XMPP and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_C._F._Greve">Georg Greve</a> from FSFE was impressive.<br><br>As a result 
it became a loved tradition of Thilo and myself to drive over to Brussels, attend FOSDEM and watch great talks. Over 
time there were more and more familiar faces, e.g. at the FSFE booth, among the Debian people...<br><br>Last weekend I 
had an awesome time in Brussels at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=fosdem+2010&m=text">FOSDEM</a> for 
the fourth time in a row. I am honoured to have been invited by the FOSDEM organisers for a main track talk on Hadoop 
in the scalability slot (in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=janson+fosdem">Janson...</a>). <br><br>We arrived 
on Friday afternoon, however being awefully tired we unfortunately could not join the Friday evening beer event 
(though, as I am not drinking beer, I would probably have missed quite a bit of the fun).<br><br>
