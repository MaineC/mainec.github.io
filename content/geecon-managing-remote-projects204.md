# GeeCon - managing remote projects


In his talk on visibility in distributed teams Pawel Wrzeszcz motivated why working remotely might be benefitial for 
both, employees (less commute time, more family time) as well as employers (hiring world wide instead of local, getting 
more talent in). He then went into more detail on some best practices that worked for his company as well as for 
himself.<br><br>When it comes to managing your energy the trick mainly is to find the right balance between isolating 
work from private live (by having a separate area in your home, having a daily routine with fixed start and end times) 
and integrating work into your daily live and loving what you do: The more boring your job is, the less likely you are 
going to succeed when working remotely.<br><br>There are three aspects to work remotely successfully: a) having 
distributed meetings – essentially: minimize them. Have more 1 on 1 meetings to clear up any questions. Have technology 
support you where necessary (Skype is nice for calls with up to ten people, they also tried google hangouts, teamspeak 
and others. Take what works for you and your colleagues). b) For group decisions use online brainstorming tools. A wiki 
will do, so do google docs. There's fancier stuff should you need it. Asynchronous brainstorming can work. c) Learn to 
value asynchronous communication channels – avoid mail, wikis, issue trackers etc. are much better suited for longer 
documentation like communication.<br><br>Essentially what will happen is that issues within your organisation are 
revealed much more easily than working on-site.<br>
