# Apache Mahout 0.3 released


This week, Apache Mahout 0.3 was released. First of all thanks to all committers and contributors who made that 
possible: Thanks for all your hard work on making the code even faster and integrating even more algorithms.<br><br>To 
the highlights:<br><ul><li>New: math and collections modules based on the high performance Colt library <br><li>Faster 
Frequent Pattern Growth(FPGrowth) using FP-bonsai pruning<br><li>Parallel Dirichlet process clustering (model-based 
clustering algorithm)<br><li>Parallel co-occurrence based recommender<br><li>Parallel text document to vector 
conversion using LLR based ngram generation<br><li>Parallel Lanczos SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) 
solver<br><li>Shell scripts for easier running of algorithms, utilities and examples<br><ul><br><br>... and much much 
more: code cleanup, many bug fixes and performance improvements. Check out the new release and watch for further news 
on Apache Mahout to come in the next days and weeks.<br><br><br>Details on what's included can be found in the release 
notes. <br><br>Downloads are available from the Apache Mirrors
