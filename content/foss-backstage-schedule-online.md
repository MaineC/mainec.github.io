# FOSS Backstage - Schedule online


In January <a href="posts/foss-backstage-cfp-open.html">the CfP for FOSS
Backstage opened</a>. By now reviews have been done, speakers notified and a
schedule created.
<br><br>
I'm delighted to find both - a lot of friends from the Apache Software
Foundation but also a great many speakers that aren't affiliated with the ASF
among the speakers.
<br><br>
If you want to know how Open Source really works, if you want to get a glimpse
behind the stage, do not wait for too long to grab your ticket now and join us
in summer in Berlin/ Germany.
<br><br>
If project management is only partially of your interest, we have you covered as
well: For those interested in storing, searching and scaling data analysis, <a
href="http://berlinbuzzwords.de">Berlin Buzzwords</a> is scheduled to take
place in the same week. For those interested in Tomcat, httpd, cloud and iot, <a
href="http://www.apachecon.com">Apache Roadshow</a> is scheduled to happen on
the same days as FOSS Backstage - and your FOSS Backstage ticket grants you
access to Apache Roadshow as well.
<br><br>
If you're still not convinced - head over to <a
href="http://foss-backstage.de">the conference website</a> and check out the
talks available yourself.
