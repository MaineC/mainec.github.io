# Apache Dinner January 2010


This evening in X-Berg several local committers met for the second "Apache Dinner" - an informal gathering of local 
Apache committers, friends and associates for food, beer and interesting discussions. Next one is probably to be 
scheduled some time in February. Feel free to send a message to <a href="http://vafer.org/blog/">Torsten Curdt</a> to 
be included on the next invitation mail. Thanks for organizing a nice evening, Torsten. Hope to see even more Apache 
friends at the next dinner ;)
