# Dev House Berlin 2.0


This weekend <a href="http://wiki.upstream-berlin.com/index.php/DevHouseBerlin2">DevHouseBerlin</a> took place in the 
Box119, kindly organized by Jan Lehnardt, sponsored by Upstream and StudiVZ. There were about 30 people gathered in 
Friedrichshain, hacking and discussing various projects: Mostly Python/ Django, Ruby/ Rails and Erlang people. 
<br><br>The first day was reserved for hacking and exchanging ideas. Late afternoon attendees put together a list of 
talks that were than rated, ranked with the top three chosen for presentation on Sunday. The list included topics on 
CouchDB, RestMS, Hadoop, Concurrency in Erlang, P2P CouchDB and many more. The first three topics were chosen by the 
participants for presentation.<br><br>During the time at DevHouse I finally got a list of topics and papers up at <a 
href="http://github.com/MaineC/Playground">Mahout TU project</a> - now only the exact credit system for the Mahout 
course at TU is missing. I got some time to work on Mahout improvements and documentation. Unfortunately I was too 
tired today to complete the code review for MAHOUT-157 - promise to do that early next week.<br><br>Spending one 
weekend with equal-minded people, being able to pair with someone else in case of more complex problems made the 
weekend a great time for me. Planning to be there again next year. Thanks to the sponsors and organisers for making 
this happen.
