# katta @ Berlin


After finishing the slides for next week's Mahout course at TU Berlin (if you are not subscribed yet: <a 
href="https://lsf.zuv.tu-berlin.de/qisserver/servlet/de.his.servlet.RequestDispatcherServlet?state=wsearchv&search=2&ver
anstaltung.veranstid=98064">Subscribe now!</a>) I spent half of the day in <a 
href="http://www.tierpark-berlin.de/">Tierpark Berlin</a>: Watching ice-bears, taking pictures of tigers. On my way 
through the park I met those cute little guys:<br><br><img

kattas - so that is what they look like!<br><br>Oh - just in case you were searching for the real <a 
href="http://katta.sourceforge.net/">distributed lucene</a> katta ... that is available over on Sourceforge and not to 
be confused with those little animals ;)
