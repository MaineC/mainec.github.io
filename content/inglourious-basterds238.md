# Inglourious Basterds


This evening I went to the cinema <a href="http://www.yorck.de/kinos/detail/100011">Odeon</a> in Berlin Sch√∂neberg. It 
is a pretty traditional, old-fashioned and very lovely cinema that has specialised on showing non-dubbed, original 
versions of movies.<br><br>Showing the great movie <a href="http://www.inglouriousbasterds-movie.com/">Inglourious 
Basterds</a>, the cinema was completely sold out today. Fortunately we were able to grab some of the last 
tickets.<br><br>Just in case the entrance seemed familiar to those who have attended a Mahout presentation in the 
recent past - a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/extranoise/2317950586/">picture</a> of the Odeon usually 
visualises one part of my motivation on the Mahout slides ;)<br>
