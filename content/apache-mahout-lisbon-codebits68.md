# Apache Mahout @ Lisbon Codebits


Second week of November I'll spend a few days in Lisbon - never would have thought that I'd return so quickly when I 
visited this beautiful city this summer during vacation. I'll be there for Codebits - thanks to <a 
href="http://www.sapo.pt/">Sapo</a> for inviting me to be there.<br><br><img

that there was someone form Portugal seeking to meet with other Apache people exactly when I was down there. I 
contacted the guy proposing to do an Apache Dinner to see how many other committers and friends could be reached. In 
addition <a href="http://fdmanana.wordpress.com/">Filipe</a> asked me whether I could imagine flying down to Sapo to 
give a talk on Mahout as devs there would be interested in it. Well, I told him that if I got travel support, I'd be 
happy to be there. This 10min chat quickly turned into an invitation to a great conference in Lisbon. Looking forward 
to meet you there. (And looking forward to weather that compared to Germany is way warmer and more sunny right now. :) )
