# AWS User Group Berlin


On Monday the first <a href="http://www.amiando.com/AWS-Berlin.html">AWS user group</a> took place in newthinking 
store, Berlin. The event featured talks by Martin Buhr from Amazon as well as presentations of AWS users like Dawanda, 
Peritor and Sound Cloud.<br><br>Unfortunately the most interesting question concerning Elastic Map Reduce was left 
unanswered by Martin: Does using EMR facilitate exploiting data locality/ rack locality optimizations that are possible 
in Hadoop? The question on whether Amazon is using the AWS APIs internally as well was answered positively, though of 
course they did not publish all of their systems infractructure.<br><br>Next meeting was scheduled to take place in two 
months time. Thanks to Peritor for organizing the meetup.
