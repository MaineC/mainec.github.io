# With a little help from my friends


The end of the year 2009 is quickly approaching. To me it feels a little like it ran away far too quickly. So instead 
of taking part in the annual review of past events, I would like to use it as an opportunity to say thank you: The past 
twelve months were a lot of fun with lots of interesting, nice people from all over the world. I got the chance to meet 
quite a bit of the Mahout community, I got lots and lots of new developers from all over Germany - or more precisely 
the EU - to attend the Apache Hadoop Get Together in Berlin. The interest in Mahout has grown tremendously over the 
past year.<br><br>All of this would not have been possible without the help of many people: First of all I'd like to 
thank Thilo Fromm - for making me happy whenever I was disappointed, for solacing me when I when I was sad, for 
patiently listening to me nervously whining before each and every talk, for kindly reviewing my slides and last but not 
least for helping me fix some of the problems that bugged me. Oh - and, thanks for helping me fix the issue in the 
zookeeper c-client within minutes that puzzled me for days. <br><br>Another big Thanks goes to family, first and 
foremost my mum, who kindly took care of organizing quite a bit of my paperwork and kept me on schedule with so many 
"unimportant" tasks like getting an appointment with some hospital to finally get the screws taken out of my knee 
;)<br><br>A special thanks goes to the growing Mahout community as well as to the Lucene people - you know, who you are 
- keep up the great work: You rock! <br><br>Furthermore there are students at TU Berlin who have shown that with Mahout 
it is "dead-simple" to write an application that, given a stream of documents, groups them by topic and makes the 
result searchable in Solr. Thanks to you for solving the minor and major problems, for communicating with the 
community, for transparently communicating problems. Looking forward to continue working together with you next 
year.<br><br>Finally a big thank you to all of the speakers, sponsors and attendees of the Apache Hadopp Get Together, 
the NoSQL conference and the Apache Dinner Berlin - without you these events would never have been possible. Looking 
forward to seeing you again in January/ March 2010!<br><br>I hope I didn't forget too many people - just in case: I am 
pretty grateful for all the input, help and feedback I got this year.<br><br>PS: Another thanks to the spaceboyz 
visiting Berlin for 26C3 for helping Thilo tidy up our apartment after Congress was over this year ;)
