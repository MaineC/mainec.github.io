# Service as in real good customer service


First thing to do after getting up: Go to the kitchen and switch on the coffee machine. However, one random Sunday 
morning that caused the fuse for exactly this kitchen to go off. After fixing that we turned on the coffee machine 
again - trying to finally get a first cup. All worked well until having a closer look at what the machine produced as 
coffee: It was cold!<br><br>We initially got the machine from Giuseppetti - a vendor in Berlin. Though it was to late 
to get it fixed on warranty we still took the thing over to <a href="http://www.giuseppetti.de/">his shop</a> the 
following week. What happened than was amazing to see for us:<br><br>The mechanics unscrewed the machine, started 
examining it immediately. Knowing we had bought it there, the owner gave both of us a cup of coffee. Long before I had 
finished mine the fixed machine was brought back to us - a fuse in it had gone off as well.<br><br>So after less than 
half an hour we got our working coffee machine back w/o being charged for the repair. Next morning was way better than 
the previous Sunday morning.
