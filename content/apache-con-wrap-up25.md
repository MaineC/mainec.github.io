# Apache Con Wrap Up


First things first - slides, audio and abstracts of Apache Con are all online now on their <a 
href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/apachecon-north-america/schedule/">Lanyrd page</a>. So if you missed the conference or 
could not attend a session due to conflicting with another interesting session - that's your chance to catch 
up.<br><br>For those of you who are speaking German, there's also a <a 
href="http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Neues-von-Apache-1379504.html">summary of Apache Con</a> available on heise 
Open. (If you don't speak German, I have been told that the Google Translate version of the site captures the gist of 
the article reasonably well.)
