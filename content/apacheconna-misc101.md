# ApacheConNA: Misc


<P><br>In his talk on Spdy Mathew Steele explained how he implemented the spdy protocol<br>as an Apache httpd module - 
working around most of the safety measures and<br>design decisions in the current httpd version. Essentially to get 
httpd to<br>support the protocol all you need now is mod_spdy plus a modified version of<br>mod_ssl.<br><br><P><br>The 
keynote on the last day was given by the Puppet founder. Some interesting<br>points to take away from 
that:<br><br><P><br><br><UL><br><LI>Though hard in the beginning (and half way through, and after years) it<br>is 
important to learn giving up control: It usually is much more productive and<br>leads to better results to encourage 
people to do something than to be<br>restrictive about it. A single developer only has so much bandwidth - 
by<br>farming tasks out to others - and giving them full control - you substantially<br>increase your throughput 
without having to put in more energy.<br></LI><br><LI>Be transparent - it's ok to have commercial goals with your 
project. Just<br>make sure that the community knows about it and is not surprised to learn 
about<br>it.<br></LI><br><LI>Be nice - not many succeed at this, not many are truely able to ignore<br>religion (vi vs. 
emacs). This also means to be welcoming to newbies, to hustle<br>at conferences, to engage the community as opposed to 
announcing changes.<br></LI><br></UL><br><br><P><br>Overall good advise for those starting or working on an OSS project 
and seeking<br>to increase visibility and reach.<br><br>If you want to learn more on what other talks were given at
