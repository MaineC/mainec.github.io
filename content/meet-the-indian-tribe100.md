# ApacheConNA: Meet the indian tribe


ApacheCon is the ``User Conference of the Apache Software Foundation''. What<br>should that mean? If you are going to 
Apache Con you have the chance of meeting<br>committers of your favourite projects as well as members of the 
foundation<br>itself. Though there are a lot of talks that are interesting from a technical<br>point of view the goal 
really is to turn you into an active member of the<br>foundation yourself. This is true for the North American version 
even more than<br>for the European edition.<br><br><P><br>Though why should you as a general user of Apache software be 
interested in<br>attending then? Pieter Hintjens put it quite nicely in an interview on his<br>latest ZeroMQ book with 
O'Reilly:<br><br><P><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vOQEBSq7kOE" frameborder="0" 
allowfullscreen></iframe><br><P><br>If you are using free software in particular in commercial setups you really 
do<br>want to know how the project is governed and what it takes to get active and<br>involved yourself. What would it 
take to move the project into a direction that<br>fits your business needs? How do you make sure features you need are 
actually<br>being added to the project instead of useless stuff?<br><br><P><br>ApacheCon is the conference to find out 
how Apache projects work internally,<br>the place to be to meet active people in person and put faces to names. Lots 
of<br>community building events focus on getting newbies in touch with long term<br>contributors.<br><br><P>
