# First Apache Dinner Berlin


A few days ago, I received a mail from <a href="http://vafer.org/">Torsten Curdt</a> that read something like: "[...] 
For a long time now I wanted to organise an Apache Dinner Berlin. What do you think, when would be a good time for 
that?". As that was about the third time I heard of that idea (and the third person mentioning the idea), I included 
some Berlin-based Apache-people asking whether they would be interested in having an Apache Dinner on November 24st in 
X-Berg. General answer: Yes! Sure!<br><br>The idea was to make it open to anyone interested in the ASF and send 
invitations to committers who are living in the greater-Berlin-area. Then book a table, have some food, get some 
drinks...<br><br>We met at Graefekiez - we, that is <a href="http://vafer.org/">Torsten</a> (Jakarta and Hadoop), <a 
href="http://jan.prima.de/plok/">Jan</a> and Daniel (CouchDB), Simon+Vera (Lucene), <a 
href="http://oswaldism.de/">oswald</a> (xampp), Eric (Http Components) and myself - for a great "small menu" at La 
Buona Forchetta (Thanks to Torsten for coming up with that restaurant and booking the table). After that some of us 
moved over to a bar close to the restaurant.<br><br>After a long evening with lots of interesting (cross-project as 
well as non-technical) discussions, the general conclusion was to organize another Apache Dinner some time in January 
after Christmas-time is over:<br><br>Thanks guys for a great evening. Hope to see you all - as well as a few more 
Apache people from around Berlin -  in January. Date and location to be set.<br><br>Final note to self: No Club Mate 
for Isabel after 02:00 a.m. ...
