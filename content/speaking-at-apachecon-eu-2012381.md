# Speaking at ApacheCon EU 2012


I'll be at <a href="http://www.apachecon.eu">ApacheCon EU</a> in November. Looking forward to an interesting conference 
on all things Apache that is finally returning back to Europe. Go there if you want to learn more on Tomcat, Hadoop, 
httpd, HBase, Camel, Open Office, Mahout, Lucene and more.<br><br>Now on to prepare the two talks I 
submitted:<br><br><ul><br><li>"Choosing the right tool for your data analysis task - Apache Mahout in 
context"<br><li>"I was voted to be committer. Now what?"<br></ul><br><br>Looking forward to see you there.
