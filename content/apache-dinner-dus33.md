# Apache Dinner DUS


the evening after FrOSCon - that is on August 22nd 2010 at 7:30p.m. CEST - a combined "FSFE Fellowship meetup/ Apache 
dinner*" takes place in Tigges in Düsseldorf (Brunnenstraße 1, at Bilker S-Bahnhof). Given it doesn't rain, we'll be 
sitting outside.<br><br>Would be great to meet you there for tasty food, interesting discussions on Apache in general, 
as well as projects like Lucene, Hadoop or Tomcat in particular. Anyone interested in either the FSFE or Apache is 
welcome to join us.<br><br>One personal request: Somehow, Rainer (Kersten, FSFE) talked me into preparing a talk on 
what the ASF is all about - would be really great to have more people around share their experience.<br><br><br>See you 
in Düsseldorf
