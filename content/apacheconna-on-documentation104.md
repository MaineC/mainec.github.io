# ApacheConNA: On documentation


<P><br>In her talk on documentation on OSS Noirin gave a great wrap up of the topic of<br>what documentation to create 
for a project and how to go about that task.<br><br><P><br>One way to think about documentation is to keep in mind that 
it fulfills<br>different tasks: There is conceptual, procedural and task-reference<br>documentation. When starting to 
analyse your docs you may first want to debug<br>the way it fails to help its users: ``I can't read my mail'' really 
could mean<br>``My computer is under water''.<br><br><P><br>A good way to find awesome documentation can be to check 
out Stackoverflow<br>questions on your project, blog posts and training articles. Users today really<br>are searching 
instead of browsing docs. So where to find documentation actually<br>is starting to matter less. What does matter 
though is that those pages with<br>relevant information are written in a way that makes it easy to find them<br>through 
search engines: Provide a decent title, stable URLs, reasonable tags<br>and descriptions. By the way, both infra and 
docs people are happy to talk to<br>*good* SEO guys.<br><br><P><br>In terms of where to keep 
documentation:<br><br><P><br>For conceptual docs that need regular review it's probably best to keep them in<br>version 
control. For task documentation steps should be easy to upgrade once<br>they fail for users. Make sure to accept bug 
reports in any form - be it on<br>Facebook, Twitter or in your issue tracker.<br><br><P><br>When writing good 
documentation always keep your audience in mind: If you don't<br>have a specific one, pitch one. Don't try to cater for 
everyone - if your docs<br>are too simplistic or too complex for others, link out to further material.<br>Understand 
their level of understanding. Understand what they will do after<br>reading the docs.<br><br><P><br>On a general level 
always include an about section, a system overview, a<br>description of when to read the doc, how to achieve the goal, 
provide<br>examples, provide a trouble shooting section and provide further information<br>links. Write breadth first - 
details are hard to fill in without a bigger<br>picture. Complete the overview section last. Call out context 
and<br>pre-requesites explicitly, don't make your audience do more than they really<br>need to do. Reserve the details 
for a later document.<br><br><P><br>In general the most important and most general stuff as well as the 
basics<br>should come first. Mention the number of steps to be taken early. When it comes<br>to providing details: The 
more you provide, the more important the reader will<br>deem that part.<br>
