# Open Street Map @ FSFE meetup


At the last meeting of the local FSFE group here in Berlin Sabine Stengel from cartogis gave a presentation on Open 
Street Map. But instead of focussing on the technical side she described the legal issues and showed the broad variety 
of commercial projects that are possible with this type of mapping information.<br><br>It was interesting to learn of 
how detailed and high quality the information provided by volunteers really is. I think it will be interesting to see, 
how the project keeps traction after "everything is mapped" - how it remains interesting to stay involved, to keep the 
information up to date over a longer period of time.
