# Apache Con – Wrap up


After one week of lots of interesting input the ASF's user conference was over. With a focus on Apache software users 
quite a few talks are not too well suited for conference regulars but more or less targeted at newbies who want to know 
who too successfully apply the software. As a developer of Mahout with close ties to the Lucene and Hadoop community 
what is of course most interesting to me are stories of users putting the software into production.<br>The conference 
was well organised: The foundation features way more projects at the moment than can reasonably be covered in just one 
conference. As a result Apache Con only covers only a subset of what is being developed at Apache. As such more and 
more smaller community organised events are being run by individuals as well as corporations. Still Apache Con is a 
nice place to get in touch with other developers – and to get a glimpse of what is going on in project outsides ones 
own regular community.
