# Open Source Meetup Berlin


This evening the (to my knowledge first) <a 
href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/berlin-open-source-meetup.html">Berlin Open Source Meetup</a> took place at 
Prater (Bier-)garten in Berlin. There are lots of project specific meetings, a monthly <a 
href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/groups/Berlin">Free Software</a> meeting, quite some stuff on project management. However 
this was one of the rare occasions where you get Linux kernel hackers, Wikidata project members, Debian developers, 
security people, mobile developers as well as people writing on free software or making movies related to the topic 
around one table.<br><br>Despite the heat (over 30 degrees Celcius in Berlin today) over 30 people gathered for some 
food, cold beer, some drinks and lots of interesting discussions. Would be great to see another edition of this kind of 
event.
