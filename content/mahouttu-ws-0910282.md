# Mahout@TU WS 09/10


<strong>Title: </strong>Mahout@TU WS 09/10<br /><br><br>There is going to be a project/seminar course at TU Berlin on 
Apache Mahout. The goal is to introduce students to the work on a free software project, interact with the community 
and build production ready software.<br><br>Students will be given several potential tasks ranging from optimizing 
existing implementations, implementing new algorithms and (depending on their prior knowledge) improving, scaling and 
parallelizing existing algorithms.<br><br>Successful completion of the course depends on a number of factors: 
Interaction of the student with the community, ability to write tested (as in test-first-developed) code that performs 
well in a large scale environments, ability to show incremental development progress at each iteration, ability to 
review patches and improvements, usage of tools like SCM, Issue-tracker and mailinglists. Of course theoretical 
background - that is understanding existing publications as well extending their ideas is crucial as well.<br><br>If 
you are a student interessted in Mahout missing some course work, consider subscribing to the Mahout course at DIMA 
Berlin (linked below). Goal is that your work is to be integrated in one of the next releases, once the community is 
satisfied.<br><br>If you are a Mahout developer or user and have some issue that you consider suitable for a student to 
solve, please to provide your ideas.<br><br><br/><strong>Location: </strong>TU Berlin<br /><strong>Link out:
