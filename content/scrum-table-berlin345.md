# Scrum Table Berlin


Last week I attended the scrum table Berlin. This time around Phillippe gave a presentation on "backlog colours", that 
is types of work items tracked in the backlog.<br><br>The easiest type to track are features - that is items that 
generate revenue and are on the wishlist of the customer. Second type of items he sees are infrastructure items - that 
is, things needed to implement several features but invisible to the customer. Third type are bugs. Basically these are 
diminishing the value of features one had already classified as done earlier in the process. Fourth and last type are 
technical debt items - that is shortcuts taken or bad design choices (either knowingly as intentional decision made to 
meet some deadline or unintentional due to lack of experience).<br><br>A very simple classification could be the 
following 
matrix:<br><br><table><br><tr><td>Name</td><td>Value</td><td>Cost</td></tr><br><tr><td>Feature</td><td>Visible <font 
color="green">Positive</font></td><td><font 
color="red">Positive</font></td></tr><br><tr><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Invisible <font 
color="green">Positive</font></td><td><font color="red">Positive</font></td></tr><br><tr><td>Bug</td><td>Visible <font 
color="red">Negative</font></td><td><font color="red">Positive</font></td></tr><br><tr><td>Technical 
Debt</td><td>Invisible <font color="red">Negative</font></td><td><font 
color="red">Positive</font></td></tr><br></table><br><br>All four types of items exist in the real world. The 
interesting part is making these visible, assigning costs to each of them and scheduling these items in the regular 
sprint intervals.<br><br>The full presentation can be downloaded:
