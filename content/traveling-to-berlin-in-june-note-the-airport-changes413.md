# Traveling to Berlin in June? Update: No airport changes!


<b>Update</b>: Seems like there won't be any airport changes for Berlin Buzzwords: <a

eck-stinksauer/6604068.html">German article at Tagesspiegel</a> on postponing airport 
opening.<br><br><hr/><br><hr/><br><hr/><br><br><br>If you are planning to travel to Berlin in June – e.g. to attend 
Berlin Buzzwords – note that there is a major change to airports happening on June 2nd:<br><br>Saturday, June 2nd will 
be the last day, both Schönefeld Airport (SXF) as well as Tegel Airport (TXL) are going to be open. All planes 
departing TXL that day will arrive at SXF in the evening.<br><br>The morning after (Sunday, June 3rd) airport Berlin 
Brandenburg International (also known as BBI, IATA code BER) is going to open. This airport is located very close to 
Schönefeld, there will be trains and busses connecting it to the city.<br><br>Airlines should handle this change 
transparently. However when arriving at TXL make sure to check which airport you are departing from to avoid ending up 
in front of closed doors ;) Also should you be arriving from the US keep in mind that there will be a few more direct 
connections to Berlin starting June 3rd – e.g. Air Berlin will offer multiple daily flights to and from New York and 
Miami.<br><br>When travelling from the airport to the conference by public transport, keep in mind that for TXL you 
only need a ticket covering zones A and B – for SXF and BER your need to purchase a ticket that is valid for zones A, B 
and C.<br><br>Travelling from TXL to the conference venue and speaker hotel by cab is roughly 30 Euros. For BER the 
fare is roughly 50 Euros.
