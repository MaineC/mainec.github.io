# Teddy in Down Under


The last two September weeks Teddy was in Down Under. He spent the first few days exploring Sydney: Taking the ferry 
from Manly to the city each morning, followed by beautiful sunny weather, warm enough to already go 
swimming.<br><br><center><img src="/syd_2012_1.jpg"></center><br><br>The 
following days took him to the Blue Mountains and into Kangaroo Valley for some hiking, animal watching and 
kayaking:<br><br><center><img src="/syd_2012_3.jpg"></center><br><br>Of course 
Teddy also made some new friends:<br><br><center><img

for hosting us in Sydney. Thanks also to Brett, Laura, Samantha and Tobi for hosting us in the Blue Mountains. And 
thanks to the folks joining us on our very last evening for a Apache Dinner. Was great meeting you â€“ looking forward to 
see you again soon.<br><br>Also thanks to Thoralf, Anja, Astro, Douwe, Stefan, Nick, Brett and everyone else who 
provided us with lots of hints and recommendations on what to do in and near Sydney. As usual it was too little time 
for too much to do and see.
