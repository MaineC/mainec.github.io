# Erlang User Group - Scala


What: Scala Presentation by Stefan Plantikow.<br>Where: Cockpit of the Box119 http://boxhagener119.de/ (Ring at 
UPSTREAM)<br>When: Wednesday, 11.03.2009, 8:00 p.m. <br><br>Yesterday the Erlounge, organised by Jan Lehnardt, took 
place in the Cockpit of Box119 in Berlin. Topic of the evening was an introduction to Scala.<br><br>Scala is a 
functional language that compiles to Java Bytecode and runs on the JVM. It tries to combine the best from two worlds: 
Object oriented languages and functional programming. So every function is an object and every object is a 
function.<br><br>Some interesting bits of information: <br><ul><br>  <li> Scala is a statically typed language - but 
you can omit the types most of the times as type inference in the compiler is pretty good.<br>  <li> Everything is an 
object - there is no difference in primitives and objects.<br>  <li> There are packages for distributed computing - 
spawning processes and sending messages is not as fast as in Erlang there is still room for improvement.<br>  <li> The 
developers are currently about to tidy up the syntax and take care of corner cases.<br>  <li> It is easy to start with 
Scala as you can start out with a subset of the language and extend your knowledge as you need.<br>  <li> Scala means 
Scalable language. Scalable in terms of projects and tasks you can accomplish with it.<br></ul><br><br>If you want to 
see a second nice presentation that is slightly less focussed on comparing Scala to Erlang you might also find this 
year's FOSEM presentation interesting: http://www.slideshare.net/Odersky/fosdem-2009-1013261 (video should be up soon 
as well).
