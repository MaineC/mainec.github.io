# An argument against proxies


Proxies? In companies getting started with an upstream first concept this is
what people are called who act as the only interface between their employer and
an open source project: All information from any project used internally flows
through them. All bug reports and patches intended as upstream contribution also
flows through them - hiding entire teams producing the actual contributions.

<br><br> At Apache projects I learnt to dislike this setup of having proxies act
in place of the real contributors. Why so?

<br><br> Apache is built on the premise of individuals working together in the
best interest of their projects. Over time, people who prove to commit
themselves to a project get added to that project. Work contributed to a project
gets rewarded - in a merit doesn't go away kind-of sense working on an Apache
project is a role independent of other work committments - in the "merit doesn't
go away" sense this merit is attached to the individual making contributions,
not to the entity sponsoring that individual in one way or another.

<br><br> This mechanism does not work anymore if proxy committers act as gateway
between employers and the open source world: While proxied employees are saved
from the tax that working in the public brings by being hidden behind proxies,
they will also never be able to accrue the same amount of merit with the project
itself. They will not be rewarded by the project for their committment. Their
contributions do not end up being attached to themselves as individuals. 

<br><br> From the perspective of those watching how much people contribute to
open source projects the concept of proxy committers often is neither
transparent nor clear. For them proxies establish a false sense of hyper
productivity: The work done by many sails under the flag of one individual,
potentially discouraging others with less time from participating: "I will never
be able to devote that much work to that project, so why even start?"

<br><br> From an employer point of view proxies turn into single point of
failure roles: Once that person is gone (on vacation, to take care of a
relative, found a new job) they take the bonds they made in the open source
project with them - including any street cred they may have gathered.

<br><br> Last but not least I believe in order to discuss a specific open source
contribution the participants need a solid understanding of the project itself.
Something only people in the trenches can acquire.

<br><br> As a result you'll see me try and pull those actually working with a
certain project to get active and involved themselves, to dedicate time to the
core technology they rely on on a daily basis, to realise that working on these
projects gives you a broader perspective beyond just your day job.
