# Apache Con – Mahout, commons and Lucene


The second day the track interesting to me provided an overview of some of the Apache commons projects. So seemingly 
small in scope and light-weight in implementation and dependencies these projects provide vital features not yet well 
supported by the Sun JVM. There is a commons math implementation featuring a fair amount of algebraic, numeric and 
trigonometric functions (among others), the commons exec framework for executing processes externally to the JVM w/o 
running into the danger of creating dead-locks or wasting resources.<br><br>After that the Mahout and Lucene 
presentations were up. Grant gave a great overview of various use-cases of machine learning in the wild, rightly 
claiming that anyone using the internet today makes use of some machine learning powered application each day – be it 
e-mail spam filtering, the Gmail priority inbox, recommendaed articles on news sites, recommended items to buy at 
shopping sites or targeted advertisements shown when browsing. The talk was concluded by  a more detailed presentation 
of how to successfully combine the features of Mahout and Lucene/Solr to built next generation web services that 
integrate user feedback into their user experience.
