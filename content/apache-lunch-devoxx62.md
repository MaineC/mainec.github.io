# Apache Lunch Devoxx 


On Twitter I suggested to host an Apache dinner during Devoxx. Matthias Wesendorf of Apache MyFaces was so kind to take 
up the discussion carrying it over to the Apache community mailing-list. It quickly turned out that there was quite 
some interest with several members and committers attending Devoxx. We scheduled the meetup for Friday after the 
conference during lunch time.<br>I pinged a few Apache related people I knew would attend the conference (being a 
speaker and a committer at some Apache project almost certainly resulted in getting a ping). Steven Noels kindly made a 
reservation at a restaurant close by and announced time and geo coordinates on party.apache.org. Although several 
speakers had left already that very same morning, we turned out to be eleven people – including Stephen Coleburn, 
Mathias Wessendorf, Steven Noels, Martijn Dashorst of the Apache Wicked project. Was great meeting all of you – and 
being able to put some faces to names :)<br>
