# Machine Learning Gossip Meeting Berlin


This evening the first Machine Learning Gossip meeting is scheduled to take place at 9p.m. at Victoriabar: 
Professionals working in research advancing machine learning algorithms and industry projects putting machine learning 
algorithms to practical use meet for some drinks, food and hopefully lots of interesting discussions.<br><br>If 
successful the meeting is supposed to take place on a regular schedule. Ask <a 
href="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~mibrueck/">Michael Br&uuml;ckner</a> for the date and location of the next meetup.
