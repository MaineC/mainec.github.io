# One year coding with "Das Keyboard"


Little more than a year ago, I got myself a keyboard from newthinking store.  The special thing about it: It is 
completely black, except for three blue LEDs. With completely I mean no labels on any key:<br><br><img

the missing labels (although that certainly does make it a cool gadget). I am typing 8h at work and do spend quite a 
bit of time in front of my laptop after work as well. So I wanted a keyboard that is fun to use: This includes typing 
speed and the tactile feedback of each key.<br><br>I must admit that today, I am hardly ever happy with any other 
keyboard - usually my hands start protesting after about half an hour. So, despite some odd looks I get at work, it did 
help increase coding fun :)
