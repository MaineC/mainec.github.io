# Feedback from the Hadoop User Group UK


A few weeks after the Hadoop User Group UK is over, there are quite a few postings on the event online. I will try to 
keep this page updated if there are any further reviews. The one I found so 
far:<br><br>http://huguk.org/2009/04/huguk-2-wrap-up.html - the wrap-up of the event 
itself.<br><br>http://blog.oskarsson.nu/2009_04_01_archive.html - a short summary by the organiser - Thanks again for a 
great event.<br><br>http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2009/04/21/hadoop-uk-user-group-meeting/ - a short summary on the 
Cloudera blog.<br><br>http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/adam/?p=26 - a quick overview with a Mahout focus by Adam 
Rae.<br><br>
