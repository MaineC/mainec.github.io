During Apache Con ATL Michael Cot√© interviewed Grant Ingersoll on Apache Mahout. The interview is available online as

use cases of the project, goes into some detail on the reasons for initially starting it. If you are wondering what 
Mahout is all about, what you can do with it and which direction development is heading, the interview is a great 
option to find out more.
