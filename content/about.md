# About this blog

This is the blog of Isabel. I'm a member of the Apache Software Foundation, co-founder of Apache Mahout and mentored several incubating projects. I'm interested in all things FOSS, search and text mining with a decent machine learning background. True to the nature of people living in Berlin I love having friends here for a brief visit - as a result I co-founded and am still one of the creative heads behind Berlin Buzzwords, a tech conference on all things search, scale and storage as well as FOSS Backstage.
