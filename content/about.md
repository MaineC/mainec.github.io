# About this blog

This is the blog of Isabel. I am committer at Apache Mahout. In my free time I am working on Apache Mahout, organising the Apache Hadoop Get Together in Berlin and speaking at various conferences explaining the ins and outs of Hadoop in general and Mahout in particular.

Disclaimer: I am writing this blog with my “Apache hat” on my head. The opinions expressed herein are my own personal opinions and do not represent my employer’s view in any way. Except when explicitly stated otherwise activities and events described are not related to my daytime job.
