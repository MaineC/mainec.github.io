# Open Source Expo 09


I spent last Sunday and the following Monday at Open Source Expo Karlsruhe - co-located with web-tech and 
php-conference organized by the Software-and-Support Verlag. Together with Simon Willnauer I ran the Lucene/Mahout 
booth at the expo.<br><br>So far the conference is still very small (about 400 visitors) compared to free software 
community events. However the focus was set to be more on professional users, accordingly several projects showed that 
free software can be used successfully for various business use cases. Visitors were invited to ask Sun about their 
free software strategy. Questions concerning OpenJDK or MySQL were not uncommon. Large distributors like SuSE or 
Mandriva were present as well. But also smaller companies e.g. providing support for Apache OfBIZ were 
present.<br><br>The Apache Lucene project was invited as exhibitor as well. Together with PRC and ConCom we organized 
for an Apache banner. Lucid Imagination sponsored several Lucene T-Shirts to be distributed at the conference. At the 
very last minute information (abstract, links to projects and mailing lists and current users) was put together on 
flyers.<br><br>We arrived on Saturday, late evening. Together with a friend of mine we went for some indian food at a 
really good restaurant close to the hotel. Big thanks to her, for being our tourist guide - hope to see you back in 
Waldheim in December ;)<br><br><img src="/yacy.jpg" 
style="float:right;"><br><br>Sunday was pretty quiet - only few guests arrived at the weekend. I was invited by David 
Zuelke to give a brief introduction to Mahout during his MapReduce Hadoop tutorial workshop. Thanks, David. Though 
lunch was served already, people did stay to hear my presentation on large scale machine learning with Mahout. I got 
contacted by one of the students of Katarina Morik who was pretty interested in the project. Back at her research group 
people are working on Rapid Miner - a tool for easy machine learning. It comes with a graphical user interface that 
makes it simple to explore various algorithm configurations and data workflow setups. It would be interesting to see 
how this tool helps people to understand machine learning. Would also be very interesting to learn what form of 
contribution might be interesting and appropriate for research groups to contribute to Mahout. Maybe not code-wise but 
more in terms of discussions and background knowledge.<br><br>Sunday was a bit more busy, with more people attending 
the conferences. Simon got a slot to present Lucene at the Open Stage track and show off the new features of Lucene 
2.9. Those using Lucene already could be tricked into telling their Lucene success-story at the beginning of the talk. 
At the booth we had a wide variety of people: From students trying to find a crawling and indexing system for their 
information retrieval course homework up to professionals with various questions on the Apache Lucene project. The 
experience of people at the conference varied widely. That proved to be a pretty good reality-check. Being part of the 
Lucene and the ASF community one might be tempted to think that not knowing about Lucene is almost impossible. Well, it 
seems to be less impossible than at least I expected.<br><br>One last success: As the picture shows, Yacy now is 
powered by Lucene as well - at least in terms of T-Shirt ;)<br>
