# Moving to a new domain


Executive summary: This is to warn those of you who are subscribed to this blog - the domain to reach this blog w/o 
redirects will soon change to by <a href="http://isabel-drost-fromm.de">isabel-drost-fromm.de</a> - you might want to 
adjust your rss subscription accordingly.<br><br>Longer version: This blog post is scheduled to go live some time after 
lunch-time on September 12th 2012. You might have heart rumors before - that date Ms. Isabel Drost and Mr. Thilo Fromm 
are supposed to get married. <br><br><center><img 
src="/wedding.jpg"/></center><br><br>There were times when war and conflicts 
between kingdoms were settled by having children of the reigns get married. Today this old tradition is being continued 
on a much smaller scale by having a couple get married that is comprised of one half being passionate about Linux 
Kernel hacking and a strong proponent of GPL/LGPL open source licensing and the other half coming from the Java world, 
mainly contributing to ASL projects.<br><br>As a bit of "showing of good will" both agreed to the proposal of <a 
href="https://fsfe.org/about/kirschner/kirschner.en.html">Matthias Kirschner</a>: Girls that are FSFE fellows really 
should only marry other FSFE fellows. So we got Thilo a fellowship membership setup very quickly.<br><br>PS: Now 
looking forward to dancing into a new part of life this evening ;)<br><br>Pps: Thanks to photomic for the DLSR fotos, 
and to masq for taking the above picture and mailing it to my server. Having a secure shell on your mobile phone rocks!
