# Some useful OSPO links

* https://todogroup.org/ ... TODO group of Linux Foundation generally collecting material around OSPOs and getting people interested in the topic together
* https://github.com/github/github-ospo/?tab=readme-ov-file ... OSPO policy templates as published by GitHub's OPSO
* [Documentation skeleton](https://github.com/deven-org/documentation-skeleton) ... skeleton for things to document in an OSS project.
* [Quilin](https://dev.to/schalkneethling/qilin-a-starter-project-template-for-every-open-source-project-350e) ... a starter project template for Open Source, and likely InnerSource, projects

Keeping the above here to not loose them when cleaning my open tabs.
