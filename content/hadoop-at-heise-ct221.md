# Hadoop at Heise c't


&lt;surreptitious_advertising&gt;<br>Interesting for those readers speaking German: Heise published an introductory 
article on Hadoop in its <a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/inhalt/2010/04/180/">latest issue</a>. Have fun 
reading.<br>&lt;surreptitious_advertising/&gt;<br><br>Thanks to Simon for proof-reading and providing valuable input. 
Thanks to Thilo Fromm for the <a href="http://thilo-fromm.de/~t-lo/presentations.html#hadoop_illustrations"> hadoop 
graphics</a> (unfortunately none of them got published in its original form), the catchy title, proof-reading the text 
over and over again and for keeping me sane during several past and coming months.<br><br>If you want to know more on 
Apache Hadoop, come watch my <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM Hadoop talk next weekend</a>. If you want to join 
discussions on Apache Hadoop and Lucene, stay tuned for a <a href="http://hadoopberlin.de">conference in Berlin</a> on 
these topics.<br><br>
