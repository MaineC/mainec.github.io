# Apache Dinner June 2010


After Berlin Buzzwords was over yesterday - and as there is an svn conference in the city that starts tomorrow, we 
thought we could easily put together a smallish Apache Dinner for tonight. So Torsten mailed a few people, booked some 
space at Heinz Minki in Kreuzberg. We announced it at the end of the conference and invited people to join 
us.<br><center><br><table><tr><br><td><img src="/dinner_june_3.jpg"

Apache related guys and girls having drinks and great pizza: We had several svn committers, <a

svn conference. Of couse the usual suspects were there as well: Simon Willnauer and his wife, Torsten Curdt, Erik 
Abele, <a href="http://www.woehlke.org/blog/index.php/2010/06/10/apache-dinner-berlin/">Thomas WÃ¶hlke</a>, Valerie 
Hajdik. In addition we had guests from the Apache Lucene and Apache Hadoop communities: Sarah Sproehnle and Aaron 
Kimball as well as Uwe Schindler joined us.<br><center><br><br><table><tr><br><td><img
