# Apache Sling and Jackrabbit event coming to Berlin


Interested in Apache Sling and/or Apache Jackrabbit? Then you might be interested in hearing that on September 26th to 
28th there will be an event in town on these two topics - mainly organised by Adobe, but labeled as community event, 
meaning that there will be a number of active community members attending the conference: <a 
href="http://experiencedelivers.adobe.com/cemblog/en/experiencedelivers/2012/07/adaptto2012.html">adaptTo()</a>.<br><br>
From their website:<br><br><blockquote>In late September 2012 Berlin will become the global heart beat for developers 
working on the Adobe CQ technical stack. pro!vision and Adobe are working jointly to set up a pure technical event for 
developers that will be focused on Apache Sling, Apache Jackrabbit, Apache Felix and more specifically on Adobe CQ: 
adaptTo(), Berlin. September 26-28 2012.</blockquote><br><br><br>
