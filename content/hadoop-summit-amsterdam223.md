# Hadoop Summit Amsterdam


<P><br>About a month ago I attended the first European Hadoop Summit, organised by<br>Hortonworks in Amsterdam. The two 
day conference brought together both vendors<br>and users of Apache Hadoop for talks, exhibition and after conference 
beer<br>drinking.<br><br><P><br>Russel Jurney kindly asked me to chair the Hadoop applied track during<br>Apache Con 
EU. As a result I had a good excuse to attend the event. Overall<br>there were at least three times as many submissions 
than could reasonably be<br>accepted. Accordingly accepting proposals was pretty hard.<br><br><P><br>Though some of the 
Apache community aspect was missing at Hadoop summit it was<br>interesting nevertheless to see who is active in this 
space both as users as<br>well as vendors.<br><br><P><br>If you check out the talks on Youtube make sure to not miss 
the two sessions by<br>Ted Dunning as well as the talk on handling logging data by Twitter.<br><br><P>
