# FSFE Happy Valentine


Today I got woken up with a friendly hug and roses waiting for me:<br><br><img

sort-of-artificial celebration days like valentines day. However, FSFE had a very nice idea: The proposal was to use 
valentines day to show your love for free software. The website proposed to e.g. hug a free software developer, to make 
a gift to a team of free software developers:<br><br><a
