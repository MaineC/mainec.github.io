# Apache Dinner Berlin - August 2010


Simon (Willnauer) just sent around the following e-mail. If you have some time left next Monday evening, come join us 
in Yogihaus: For tasty Indian food, geeky discussions and a generally beautiful evening.<br><br><blockquote><br>Unlike 
the other dinner mails this one is not a poll, it's an announcement. Some Apache folks are in town next monday (9th of 
August) so we decided to have a Apache Dinner with a short term notice. If you plan to come please shoot me a quick 
heads-up and I count you in!<br><br>We will meet at http://www.restaurant-yogihaus-berlin.de/ on Monday 9th of August 
at 7:30 pm. I will reserve a table for about 14 people (the average size of the last two meetings while gstein and his 
gang wasn't  counted :D)<br><br>Looking forward to meet you there on 
Monday!!<br><br>Simon<br><br></blockquote><br><br>Looking forward to seeing you on Monday evening next week. Please do 
not forget to give Simon a quick heads-up if you are coming: Would be nice if our estimated number of guests would at 
least be close to the real number this time (instead of somewhere at 50% ;) ).<br><br>In the unlikely event that you 
can't make it next Monday, please subscribe to our <a 
href="http://lists.isabel-drost.de/mailman/listinfo/apachedinner">Apache Dinner Mailinglist</a> to recieve further 
announcements. If you are not living in Berlin but are still interested in dropping in from time to time: Don't worry 
we do take into account that schedules of people travelling here are tight and organise meetings 
accordingly.<br><br>Update: Corrected year - must have mixed that up with another conference's kick off meeting that 
takes place today...
