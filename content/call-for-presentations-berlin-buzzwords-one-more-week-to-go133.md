As a little reminder: the <a href="http://berlinbuzzwords.de/content/call-presentations">Call for presentations</a> of 
Berlin Buzzwords will close next week on Tuesday, March 1st. Submissions on scalable search, data storage and analysis 
are all welcome. We are looking for presentations on the core technologies such as Apache Hadoop, CouchDB, Lucene, 
Redis, Voldemort but also talks on interesting use cases and system architectures.<br><br>Tickets are out for sale - 
don't wait too long to get your early bird ticket.<br><br>In addition we are in the process of drafting some additional 
packages for those of you who would like to bring their non-tech spouse to the conference or need day care facilities 
for their children. If you are interested in either package please provide feedback <a
