# BigDataCon


<P><br>Together with Uwe Schindler I had published a series of articles on Apache<br>Lucene at Software and Support 
Media's Java Mag several years ago. Earlier this<br>year S&amp;S kindly invited my to their BigDataCon - co-located 
with JAX to give a<br>talk of my choosing that at least touches upon Lucene.<br><br><P><br>Thinking back and forth 
about what topic to cover what came to my mind was to<br>give a talk on how easy it is to do text classification with 
Mahout when<br>relying on Apache Lucene for text analysis, tokenisation and token filtering.<br>All classes essentially 
are in place to integrate Lucene Analyzers with Mahout<br>vector generation - needed e.g. as a pre-processing step for 
classification or<br>text clustering.<br><br><P><br>Feel free to check out some of my sandbox code over at 
&lt;a<br>href=``http://github.org/MaineC/sofia''>github&lt;/a&gt;.<br><br><P><br>After attending the conference I can 
only recommend everyone interested in Java<br>programming and able to understand German to buy a ticket for the 
conference.<br>It's really well executed, great selection of talks (though the sponsored<br>keynotes usually aren't 
particularly interesting), tasty meals, interesting<br>people to chat with.<br><br>
