Just seen it - the next <a href="http://www.scrumtisch.net">Scrumtisch Berlin</a> has been scheduled for 25th August 
2010 at 18:30 Uhr. So far, no official talk has been scheduled, so please expect two topics on Scrum and its 
application to be selected for discussion according to Marion's agile topic selection algorithm.<br><br>Please talk to 
<a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Marion_Eickmann">Marion Eickmann</a> if you would like to attend the next meetup.
