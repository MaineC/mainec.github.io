# ApacheCon Oakland Roundup


Two weeks ago ApacheCon US 2009 ended in Oakland California. Shane published a <a 
href="http://communityovercode.com/2009/11/apachecon-oakland-roundup/">set of links to articles</a> that contain 
information on what happened at Apache Con. Some of them are officially published by the Apache PRC project, others are 
write-ups of individuals on which talks they attended and which topics they considered particularly interesting.
