# Apache Dinner - May 2010


This evening a bunch of Apache committers and friends gathered in Berlin Kreuzberg at "Goodmorning Vietnam" for tasty 
food, nice drinks - or put another way, for a very nice evening. Simon had booked the table - we were expecting no more 
than eight people. However, as with any user group these meetup tends to grow. Shortly after the appointed time we had 
to move to another table to fit everyone around. See below for a quick shot taken while eating (Thanks to Eric for 
taking the picture):<br><center><br><img

SVN, Cocoon, CouchDB, HttpComponents and various other projects. Even one potential future Mahout committer :) Counting 
attendees quickly I guess we were about fifteen people.<br><br>Looking forward to the next meetup that will be 
scheduled to take place shortely after Buzzwords. Please talk to <a href="http://vafer.org/blog/">Torsten Curdt</a> if 
you want to get notified or simply subscribe to our <a
