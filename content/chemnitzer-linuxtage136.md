# Chemnitzer Linuxtage


<strong>Title: </strong>Chemnitzer Linuxtage<br /><strong>Location: </strong>Chemnitz<br /><strong>Link out: 
</strong><a href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2010/" target="_blanck">Click here</a><br /><strong>Start Date: 
</strong>2010-03-13<br /><strong>End Date: </strong>2010-03-14<br /><br><br>Next week the Chemnither Linuxtage take 
place in - well - Chemnitz. It is the second largest Linux event after Linuxtag Berlin. However only obvious for 
speakers and exhibitors: It is one of those events that are known for its fantastic organisation. Nearly no problems, 
be it WiFi, admission to the exhibitors area, food or any help in general.<br><br>I will be at the event again. You can 
find me at the FSFE booth, telling people what the FSFE is all about and trying to convince them to become fellows (and 
yes, since last summer, I am a fellow myself and own one of those really cool green crypto cards).
