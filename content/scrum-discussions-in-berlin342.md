# Scrum discussions in Berlin


As software development cycles become ever shorter more and more companies adopt agile development methods. In many 
cases companies have switched to using Scrum or are still transitioning from less flexible approaches.<br><br>Since 
last summer Marion Eickmann is organising a Scrum Roundtable in Berlin. The goal is to discuss advantages and problems 
when introducing and practicing Scrum. But discussions on Scrum itself are also welcome.<br><br>Last Tuesday Thilo 
Fromm gave a presentation on his experiences introducing Scrum in his project. Thilo is project manager and developer 
at a company developing video surveillance hardware and software. He first gave an overview of the development process 
traditionally used in the company. Then he described how projects changed over the course of the last few years and how 
this caused new challenges to software development. Finally Thilo explained the status of implementing Scrum in one of 
his projects. He finished with (very positive reactions) from various teams in his company.<br><br>Slides are available 
online: <a href="https://www.thilo-fromm.de/~t-lo/slides/SCRUM_Waterfall/SCRUM_in_a_waterfall.pdf">Thilo Fromm: Scrum 
in the Waterfall</a><br><br>The talk was followed by very interesting discussions on this exact implementation of Scrum 
as well as experiences of other participants using Scrum for their projects. Discussions were accompanied by really 
great italian food.<br><br>The next roundtable will be announced on the <a href="http://www.agile42.com/cms/blog/">blog 
of Agile42</a>.
