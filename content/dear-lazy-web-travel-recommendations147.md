# Dear lazy web: Travel recommendations


Finally getting to spend some days of vacation in the bay area soon - so I thought I might try to leverage the lazy web 
on recommendations on what not to miss while there. So far on our list:<br><br><ul><br><li>Rent a canoo in 
Sausalito<br><li>Take a tour to Alcatras<br><li>Get to drive down along the coast towards Half Moon Bay<br><li>Spend 
one or two days strolling through the city to take photos<br><li>Do one of these touristic bike trips across the Golden 
Gate bridge<br><li>Spend a day or two to get hiking in one of the red wood tree forests<br><li>Got a recommendation to 
drive up to Lake Tahoe for two days<br><li>Get to see Napa valley<br><li>Spend a day on whale 
watching<br></ul><br><br>So that already makes up for ten days - however if you spot anything important and beautiful 
missing, please let me know. If you have any recommendation on where to spend Halloween - please also get in touch. If 
you are up to meeting for a cup of coffee or dinner and talk about Mahout, HBase, Hadoop and friends - we certainly can 
fit that into the schedule somewhere.
