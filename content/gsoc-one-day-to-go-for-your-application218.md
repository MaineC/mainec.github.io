# GSoC - one day to go for your application


If you are a student interested in participating in Google Summer of Code: Registration closes tomorrow (as in "April 
9, 19:00 UTC"). You hopefully published and discussed your proposal at your favourite project already so you have a 
clear plan of where to go and which milestones to achieve in summer.<br><br>If you are interested in Apache Mahout: 
Yes, as last years, we are again looking for students willing to work on awesome student projects this summer. Several 
core Mahout developers have signed up as mentors for GSoC. With Robin one of our former GSoC students now has turned 
into a mentor: It's always amazing to watch students stick with the project and continue contributing valuable 
input.<br><br>So in case you would love to learn more on machine learning, train your software development skills and 
work with great people on your favourite problem, do not forget to submit your project proposal until tomorrow.
