# Apache Dinner August Berlin recap


This evening yet another Apache Dinner took place in Berlin (this time Sch√∂neberg), location booked by Simon Willnauer. 
As it was announced less then a week ago (see post below) we were expecting no more then some 7 people ... we ended up 
being a group of 15 attendees: There was Michi Busch from Twitter together with Tanja, Uwe Schindler from Bremen joined 
us. With <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/">Matt</a> and Josh some of our local Hadoop users from Nokia joined our 
group. We had <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/tinkdnm4d36mnfnu">Sebastian Schelter</a> from Mahout. In addition 
there were the usual suspects, that is <a href="http://jan.prima.de/">Jan Lehnardt</a>, Simon Willnauer and <a 
href="http://vafer.org/blog/">Torsten Curdt</a>.<br><br><center><table><tr><td><img

introduce a sharing algorithm for the various dishes next time around. Speaking of next time: If you would like to be 
part of the dinner, subscribe to our <a href="http://lists.isabel-drost.de/mailman/listinfo/apachedinner">Apache Dinner 
mailing list</a>. Best way to make the location suit your needs is to simply send out the next proposal 
yourself.<br><br>As usual the Lucene guys are the last to leave: Currently they are on their way to X-Berg for further 
drinks, some food and lots of fun. Looking forward to the pictures you promised, Simon ;)<br><br>Update: Images added. 
Thanks for forwarding them.
