(nugg.ad): "Moving from five days to one hour." - This talk explains how we made data processing scalable at nugg.ad. 
The company's core business is online advertisement targeting. Our servers receive 10,000 requests per second resulting 
in data of 100GB per day.<br><br>As the classical data warehouse solution reached its limit, we moved to a framework 
built on top of Hadoop to make analytics speedy,data mining detailed and all of our lives easier. We will give an 
overview of our solution involving file system structures, scheduling, messaging and programming languages from the 
future.<br><br>Jörg Möllenkamp (Sun): "Hadoop on Sun"<br>Abstract: Hadoop is a well known technology inside of Sun. 
This talk want to show some interesting use cases of Hadoop in conjunction with Sun technologies. The first show case 
wants to demonstrate how Hadoop can used to load massive multicore system with up to 256 threads in a single system to 
the max. The second use case shows how several mechanisms integrated in Solaris can ease the deployment and operation 
of Hadoop even in non-dedicated environments. The last usecase will show the combination of the Sun Grid Engine and 
Hadoop. Talk may contain command-line demonstrations ;).<br><br>Nikolaus Pohle (nurago): "M/R for MR - Online Market
