# Early bird registration for Berlin Buzzwords on June 7th/8th open


Silently registration was opened in the past days for Berlin Buzzwords - a conference on scaling search, data 
processing and storage taking place on June 7th/8th in Berlin/ Germany. First 100 tickets will be sold for 250 Euros + 
tax. Registration is possible at later dates as well, however expect prizes to rise shortly before the conference 
starts.<br><br>If you clicked on it earlier this week and were wondering what those strange German terms were all 
about: We have put online an English version as well, so language shouldn't be much of a problem anymore.<br><br>To 
avoid any confusion: Conference talks will be in English - no German language skills needed for that. It is perfectly 
well possible to get around in Berlin w/o speaking German, however knowing a few words as always will make it easier to 
make friends with people in shops and hotels ;)
