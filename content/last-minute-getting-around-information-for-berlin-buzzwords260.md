# Last minute Getting Around information for Berlin Buzzwords


I've been sharing information on how to get around in Berlin more often than I'd like to type it out - putting it here 
for future reference.<br><br>Before going to Berlin make sure to put an app on your phone that helps with finding the 
right public transport mix to use for going from one place to another:<br><ul><br><li><a

href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.oeffi&hl=de">Ã–ffi for Android</a><br><li>There 
certainly is a comparable app for iPhones - put them in the comments and I'll add them here.<br></ul><br><br>If you 
want to get around for sight seeing - other than making sure to pack a travel guide consider renting a bike for a day 
or two. It's rather safe to ride one in Berlin, there are several routes that are all green and calm. Checkout <a 
href="http://bbbike.de/cgi-bin/bbbike.cgi">bbbike.de</a> to plan your routes - though not the prettiest website it does 
have comprehensive information on road conditions and lets you avoid cobble stones or less well lit streets. Try it out 
- it served me very well.<br><br>To actually rent a bike - ask your hotel, usually they have decent offers or can point 
you at a local bike shop that has rental offers. Prizes should be roughly 10,- Euros a day or 50,- a week.<br><br>One 
warning to pedestrians and anyone renting a car: Bicycles are very common in Berlin in particular in summer. Watch out 
when turning, don't underestimate their speed. When walking on the sidewalks watch out for lanes reserved for bikes - 
usually they are red with white stripes but can look slightly different - see also <a
