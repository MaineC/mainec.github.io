# Talking people into submitting patches


In November I am going to attend <a href="http://na11.apachecon.com/">Apache Con NA</a>. This year I decided to do a 
little experiment: I sumitted a talk on <a href="http://na11.apachecon.com/talks/19488">talking people into 
contributing to free software projects</a>. The format of the talk is a bit unusual: Drawing from my - admittedly 
limited and very biased - experience explaining free software to others and talking people into contributing patches 
this talks tries to initiate a discussion on methods to get awesome developers to consider contributing their work back 
to free software projects.<br><br>As a precursor to the talk I have created a <a 
href="http://tinyurl.com/patching-friends">public Google docs document</a> - it already contains the title of each 
slide I will use in my presentation. Of course the content does not get disclosed ahead of time.<br><br>If any of the 
readers of this blog post has experience with either explaining why they contribute, how to contribute, issues and 
questions new users have - please feel free to fill them into above document. I'll try to integrate as much feedback as 
possible into my final slides.
