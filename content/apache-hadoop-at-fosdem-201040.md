# Apache Hadoop at FOSDEM 2010


Though the official schedule is not yet online: I will be giving an introductory talk about Apache Hadoop at next 
year's FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Developer European Meeting) in Brussles. This will be the 10th birthday of the 
event - looking forward to a fun event, meeting other free and open source software developers from all over 
Europe.<br><br><center><br><img src="http://fosdem.org/2010/promo/fosdem"><br></center><br><br>If you are a Apache 
Hadoop developer and would like me to include some particular topic in the talk - please feel free to contact me. If 
you are an Apache Hadoop user and would like to learn more on the project, please come to the talk and ask questions. 
If you are an Apache Hadoop Newbie - feel free to join us.<br><br>In addition there will be a NoSQL Dev Room at FOSDEM 
as well. The call for presentations is up already. So if you are doing fun stuff with CouchDB, HBase and friends or are 
a developer of these projects - submit a talk and join us in early-February in Brussles.<!--more-->
