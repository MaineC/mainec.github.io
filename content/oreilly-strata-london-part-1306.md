# O'Reilly Strata London - part 1


A few weeks ago I attended O'Reilly Strata EU. As I had the honour of being on the program committee I remember how 
hard it was to decide on which talks to accept and which ones to decline. It's great to see that potential turned into 
an awesome conference on all things Big Data.<br><br>I arrived a bit late as I flew in only Monday morning. So I didn't 
get to see all of the keynotes and plunged right into Dyson's talk on the history of computing from Alan Turing to now 
including the everlasting goal of making computers more like humans, making them what is generally called 
intelligent.<br><br>The next keynote was co-presented by the Guardian and Google on the Guardian big data blog. 
Guardian is very well known for their innovative approach to journalism that more and more relies on being able to make 
sense of ever growing datasets â€“ both public and not-yet-published. It was quite interesting to see them use 
technologies like Google Refine for cleaning up data, see them mention common tools like Google spreadsheets or Tableau 
for data presentation and learn more on how they enrich data by joining it with publicly available datasets.<br><br>
