# Recsys meetup Berlin


Planning a meetup in Berlin: 8 people register, a table for 14 people is booked, 16+ people arrive - all of that even 
if no pre-defined topic or talk is announced. Seems like building recommender systems is a hot topic currently in 
Berlin.<br><br>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/zenogantner">Zeno Gantner</a> from <a 
href="https://github.com/zenogantner/MyMediaLite">MyMedialight</a> for organising the event - looking forward to the 
next edition.
