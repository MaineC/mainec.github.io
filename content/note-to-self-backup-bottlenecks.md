# Note to self: Backup bottlenecks


  I learnt the following relations the hard way 10 years ago when trying to
  backup
  a rather tiny amount of data, went through the computation again three years
  ago. Still I had to re-do the computation this morning when trying to pull a
  final full backup from my old MacBook. Posting here for future reference:

  Note 1: Some numbers like 10BASE-T included only for historic reference.

  Note 2: Excluded the Alice DSL uplink speed - if included the left-hand chart
  would no longer be particularly helpful or readable...
