# Devoxx Antwerp


With 3000 attendees Devoxx is the largest Java Community conference world-wide. Each year in autumn it takes place in 
Antwerp/ Belgium, in recent years in the Metropolis cinema. The conference tickets were sold out long before doors were 
opened this year.<br>The focus of the presentations are mainly on enterprise Java featuring talks by famous Joshua 
Bloch, Mark Reihnhold and others on new features of the upcoming JDK release as well as intricacies of the Java 
programming language itself.<br>This year for the first time the scope was extended to include one whole track on NoSQL 
databases. The track was organised by Steven Noels. It featured fantastic presentations on HBase use cases, easily 
accessible introductions to the concepts and usage of Hadoop.<br>To me it was interesting to observe which talks people 
would go to. In contrast to many other conferences here the NoSQL/ cloud-computing presentations were less visited than 
I'd have expected. One reason might be the fact that especially on conference day two they had to compete with popular 
topics such as the Java puzzlers, Live Java posse and others. However when talking to other attendees their seemed to 
be a clear gap between the two communities caused probably by a mixture of<br><ul><br><li>there being very different 
problems to be solved in the enterprise world vs. the free software, requirements and scalability driven NoSQL 
community. Although even comparably small companies (compared to the Googles and Yahoo!s of this world) in Germany are 
already facing scaling issues, these problems are not yet that pervasive in the Java community as a whole. To me this 
was rather important to learn, as coming from a Machine learning background, now working for a search provider and 
being involved with Mahout, Lucene and Hadoop scalability and a growth in data has always been one of the major drivers 
for any projects I have been working on so far.<br><li>Even when faced with growing amounts of data in the regular 
enterprise world developers seem to be faced with the problem of not being able to freely select the technologies to be 
used for implementing a project. In contrast to startups and lean software teams there still seem to be quite a few 
teams that are not only given what to implement but also how to implement the software unnecessarily restricting the 
tools to use to solve a given problem.<br></ul><br>One final factor that drives developers adopting NoSQL and cloud 
computing technologies is the observation for the need to optimise the system as a whole â€“ to think outside the box of 
fixed APIs and module development units. To that end the DevOps movement was especially interesting to me as only by 
getting the knowledge largely hidden in operations teams into development and mixing that with the skill of software 
developers can lead to truly elastic and adaptable systems.
