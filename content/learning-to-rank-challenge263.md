# Learning to Rank Challenge


In one of his recent blog posts, <a 
href="http://www.searchenginecaffe.com/2010/02/yahoo-learning-to-rank-challenge-at.html<br>">Jeff Dalton</a> published 
an article on currently running machine learning challenges. Especially interesting for those working on search engines 
and interested in learning new rankings from data should be the <a 
href="http://learningtorankchallenge.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge</a> to be held in conjunction with 
this year's <a href="http://www.icml2010.org/">ICML 2010</a> in Haifa, Israel. The goal is to show that your algorithm 
does not only scale on real-world data provided by Yahoo!. Tasks are split in two. The first one focusses on 
traditional learning to rank procedures, the second one on transfer learning. Tracks are open to participants from 
industry and research.<br><br>A second challenge was published <a href="http://hunch.net/?p=1236">by the machine 
learning theory blog</a>. The challenge is hosted by Yahoo! as well and deals with <a 
href="http://labs.yahoo.com/ksc">Key scientific challenges in statistics and machine learning</a>.<br><br>Both programs 
look pretty interesting - would be great to lots of people from the community participating and comparing their 
systems.<br>
