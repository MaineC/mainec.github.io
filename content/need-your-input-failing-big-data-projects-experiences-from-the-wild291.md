# Need your input: Failing big data projects - experiences from the wild


A few weeks ago my talk on "How to fail your big data project quick and rapidly" was accepted at O'Reily Strata 
conference in London. The basic intention of this talk is to share some anti-patterns, embarrassing failure modes and 
"please don't do this at home" kind of advice with those entering the buzzwordy space of big data.<br><br>Inspired by 
Thomas Sundberg's presentation on "<a 
href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/presentations2012/41_presentation.pdf">failing software projects</a> the talk 
will be split in five chapters and highlight the top two failure-factors for each.<br><br>I only have so much knowledge 
of what can go wrong when dealing with big data. In addition no one likes talking about what did not work in their 
environment. So I'd like to invite you to share your war stories in a <a href="http://titanpad.com/MVrCNj06Sn">public 
etherpad</a> - either anonymously or including your name so I can give credit. Some ideas are already sketched up - 
feel free to extend, adjust, re-rank or change.<br><br>Looking forward to your stories.
