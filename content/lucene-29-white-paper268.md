# Lucene 2.9 White Paper


Lucid recently published a <a href="http://www.lucidimagination.com/whitepaper/whats-new-in-lucene-2-9">white paper</a> 
that explains the changes and improvements that the new 2.9 release incorporates. Interesting for all who are thinking 
about upgrading to the new lucene version or generally want to know what is going on at Lucene.<br><br>
