# Happy Valentine


Free Software developers can be very critical: Every single line of code gets scrutinized, every design is reviewed by 
several often opinionated people. Even the way communities are supposed to work sometimes gets restricted. Sometimes a 
simple Thank You can make all the difference for any contributor or committer.<br><br><a

Software!"></a><br><br>FSFE proposed a really nice campaign: Celebrate the "I love Free Software" - Day on February 
14th. In the hope that some of the readers of this blog actively develop or contribute to free software projects - this 
is a thank you for you! It's your contributions that make all the difference - be it code, documentation, help for 
users or code reviews.
