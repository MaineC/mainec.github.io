# FOSS Backstage - CfP open


It's almost ten years ago that I attended my first ApacheCon EU in Amsterdam.
I wasn't entirely new to the topic of open source or free software. I attended
several talks on Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, Hadoop, Tomcat, httpd (I still
remember that the most impressive stories didn't necessarily come from the
project members, but from downstream users. They were the ones authorized to
talk publicly about what could be done with the project - and often became
committers themselves down the road.
<br><br>
With "community over code" being one of the main values at Apache, ApacheCon
also hosted several non-technical tracks: Open source and business, Open
Development (nowadays better known as <a
href="http://innersourcecommons.org">Inner Source</a>), Open Source project
management, project governance, an Apache Way talk. Over the past decade one
learning survived any wave of tech buzzword: At the end of the day, success in
Open Source (much like in any project) is defined by how well the project is
run (read: managed). Reflecting on that the idea was born to create a space to
discuss just these topics: What does it take to be "Leading the wave of open
source"? 

<br><br>
As announced on Berlin Buzzwords we (that is Isabel Drost-Fromm, Stefan
Rudnitzki as well as the eventing team over at newthinking communications GmbH)
are working on a new conference in summer in Berlin. The name of this new
conference will be "FOSS Backstage". Backstage comprises all things
FOSS governance, open collaboration and how to build and manage communities
within the open source space.

<br><br>
Submission URL: <a href="https://foss-backstage.de/call-papers">Call for
Presentations</a>

<br><br>
The event will comprise presentations on all things FOSS governance,
decentralised decision making, open collaboration. We invite you to submit talks
on the topics: FOSS project governance, collaboration, community management.
Asynchronous/ decentralised decision making.  Vendor neutrality in FOSS,
sustainable FOSS, cross team collaboration.  Dealing with poisonous people.
Project growth and hand-over. Trademarks. Strategic licensing.  While it's
primarily targeted at contributions from FOSS people, we would love to also
learn more on how typical FOSS collaboration models work well within
enterprises. Closely related topics not explicitly listed above are welcome. 

<br><br>
Important Dates (all dates in GMT +2)

<br><br>
Submission deadline: February 18th, 2018.

<br><br>
Conference: June, 13th/14th, 2018

<br><br>
High quality talks are called for, ranging from principles to practice. We are
looking for real world case studies, background on the social architecture of
specific projects and a deep dive into cross community collaboration.
Acceptance notifications will be sent out soon after the submission deadline.
Please include your name, bio and email, the title of the talk, a brief abstract
in English language.

<br><br>
We have drafted the submission form to allow for regular talks, each 45 min in
length. However you are free to submit your own ideas on how to support the
event: If you would like to take our attendees out to show them your favourite
bar in Berlin, please submit this offer through the CfP form.  If you are
interested in sponsoring the event (e.g. we would be happy to provide videos
after the event, free drinks for attendees as well as an after-show party),
please contact us.

<br><br>
Schedule and further updates on the event will be published soon on the event
web page.

<br><br>
Please re-distribute this CfP to people who might be interested.
