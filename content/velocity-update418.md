# Velocity update


<img src="/velocity_2.png" style="float: left" width="200"> After Berlin 
Buzzwords is over now, I thought it might be time to update a formerly published velocity graph. If you have been 
following this blog during the past few months you may know already, that we are using <a 
href="http://blog.isabel-drost.de/index.php/archives/12/scrum-home">Scrum @ Home</a> for several months already. I even 
published results of a <a 
href="http://blog.isabel-drost.de/index.php/archives/133/how-much-of-scrum-is-implemented">Scrum Nokia test</a> earlier 
this year.<br><br>Today I created another one of these nice velocity charts. What is interesting about this graph are 
two things. First of all: There are two spikes in the velocity graph. As our scrum board is used only for things done 
during our spare time, these spikes roughly correspond to German vacation days (Christmas and Easter).<br><br>More 
interestingly the work load shortely before Berlin Buzzwords happend was not much higher than usual. Weekend was 
totally free of any work - except for meeting with friends, going to town and attending the Barcamp. A sure sign of 
fantastic preparation and organisation with that few tasks left to do. Julia, thanks for helping with scheduling tasks 
such that no panicky late-night action was needed before, during or after the conference. <br>
