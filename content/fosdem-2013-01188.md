# FOSDEM 2013 - 01


On Friday morning our train left for this year's FOSDEM. Though a bit longish I have a strong preference for going by 
train as this gives more time and opportunity for hacking (in my case trying out Elastic Search), reading (in my case 
the book “Team Geek”) and chatting with other FOSDEM visitors.<br><br>Monday morning was mostly busy with meeting 
people - at the FSFE, Debian, Apache Open Office booths, generally in the hallways. And with getting some coffee to the 
Beaglebone booth where my husband helped out . For really fun videos on the hardware they had there see:<br><br><iframe

href="http://circuitco.com/wordpress/">circuitco</a>.<br><br>Unfortunately I didn't make it to the community and 
marketing room – too full during the talks that I wanted to see (as a general shout-out to people attending 
conferences: If you do not find a seat, move into the room instead of standing right next to the door, if you do have a 
seat and a free one just next to you, move to the seat next to you).<br><br>If you missed some of the talks you might 
want to try your luck <a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2013/">with the FOSDEM video archive</a> - it's really extensive 
featuring videos taken at previous editions as well and is a great resource to find talks of the most important tracks.
