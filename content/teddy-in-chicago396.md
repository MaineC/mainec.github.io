# Teddy in Chicago


Last week I spent several days in Chicago mainly to attend a few meetings at the local Nokia/Navteq office. Though the 
schedule was pretty packed, a few hours remained to explore the then frosty and windy city:<br><br><center><br><img

city. Bottom left: Teddy's new friend. Bottom right: Situation at ORD when flying out - fortunately both, the airport 
as well as the airline (Swiss) have quite some experience with challenging weather conditions so that we could leave 
without too much delay. </small><br></center><br><br>As usual I wondered whether there are any Apache people close by. 
So before flying in I checked <a href="http://people.apache.org/map.html">our committers map</a>. As there were a few 
people in that general area I sent a brief heads-up to the greatly under-advertised, private, non-archived, committers 
only list <a

arty@apache.org</a>. In case you've never heard about it: The main use case of that list is to provide a means for 
committers to arrange for meeting up with fellow Apache people and share travel details.<br><br>As a result I received 
a brief list of things to do in Chicago and got to attend a small but really nice meetup. Having a means to get in 
touch with locals can make such a difference - thanks for the warm welcome! Hopefully next time I'm there weather is as 
warm - would love to explore the (at least according to my travel guide book) beautiful nature of the great lakes.
