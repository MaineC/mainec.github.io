# Definition of a Blogger


While at lunch yesterday the topic of what Bloggers do, how they earn money and most important of all - what the hack a 
blogger really is - came up. Well, some criteria those who went to a restaurant nearby came up with the following 
criteria:<br><br><ul><br><li>Blog is read by more than 5 people. (Well, in my opinion a very low barrier, 
really.)<br><li>Bloggers tend to get invited to give talks at conferences. (Yeah, well, not only people with blogs get 
those invitations?)<br><li>Over time bloggers tend to get contracts, do consultancy and the like to earn money. (Hmm, 
yeah, blogs do help to get visibility...)<br><li>Bloggers tend to be involved with traditional media people. (Phew - 
finally something that disqualifies myself as a blogger. Though, come to think of it - no having published one or two 
articles does not count. Period.)<br><li>They are those people you tend to see in cafes with Mac books surfing the web. 
(Oh, well, who hasn't done that once in a while?)<br></ul><br><br>Judging from that very unscientific case-study even 
though taking into account the very informal nature, the result still appeared to be very scary to me: I had fought the 
temptation of actually creating a blog for years until publishing content for the Hadoop Get Together the very 
old-fashioned way (vim + scp) became too much of a burden. Now I have to realise that against my own judgement that I 
do tend to use this blog not exactly particularly seldom. Still trying to avoid to become one of these funny new media 
types and remain a typical free software developer :)<br><br>
