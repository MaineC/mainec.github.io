# Teddy in Portugal


During the past two weeks my teddy was on vacation. As destination he chose to fly to Portugal. One day was reserved 
for a visit to Lisboa, the capital city of the country. He also took a few really nice pictures 
there:<br><center><br><img src="http://isabel-drost.de/Bilder/wordpress/teddyLisboa.png"

friend:<br><center><br><img src="http://isabel-drost.de/Bilder/wordpress/teddyGirlFriend.png"  width="400"

explained that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_25_de_Abril">the bridge actually does exist in Lisboa</a>, 
being constructed by the same company according to the same blue prints that already were used for Golden Gate
