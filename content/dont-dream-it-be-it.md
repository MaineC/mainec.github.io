# Don't dream it, be it


After two years in a row of receiving 120 submissions for Berlin Buzzwords from
the usual crowd - young, white, male, caucasian - only this year we decided we
needed to work towards increasing diversity.One piece in the puzzle was to get
in touch with several Berlin local "tech for non-tech" people groups. In a
content exchange kind of setting I was asked to do an interview as some kind of
role model.
<br><br>
In addition to a serious lack of time back then I felt the typical way these
interviews go would do no good - even anyone who's in IT already learning
I co-founded Apache Mahout, am a member of the Apache Software foundation, have
co-founded Berlin Buzzwords (after running quite a few successful meetups around
related topics in Berlin), am married to a Linux kernel developer tends to
shy away (unless the person I'm talking to happens to be into OSS development
themselves thus knowing that despite quite some work this also means having lots
of fun).
<br><br>

However the invitation did get me started thinking about what kind of advise I
would share with the next generation of hackers. Over time though I realised
that what was most helpful for me doesn't only apply to those who want to become
successful in IT. On first sight it sounds like an extremely easy to
follow advise:

Once upon a time after coming back from the Kindergarden provided by my mom's
employer I spent part of an afternoon in front of a computer in an office close
the hers. The game was trivial: Direct a little <a

collect items, avoid biting yourself or the walls.
<br><br>

Years in primary school I got to play with the computer of one of my relatives.
Ever since beating their highscore I wanted a computer for myself. When I
finally got a first computer on my own I used to play lots of games together
with a good friend of mine - until the game supply for my Amiga 500 dried out.
Back then I made a decision: To work towards simply coding my own games. Ever
since I followed this tiny little dream - by now for almost twenty years.
<br><br>

Even despite the fact I got all support I could wish for from parents, teachers
and university professors seen from the outside it may have seemed like not
always being easy as pie: More often than not it meant being different - instead
of being part of the "I don't know what I want to do after school" it meant
being part of that small group of people who know what they are working for.
Instead of being part of that large "I hate technology and I'm utterly bad at
math" it meant being part of that tiny group of people who love math and who
have fun dealing with any new technology.
<br><br>

Instead of being at one of those great parties for New Year's Eve it meant
filling in the details of a project proposal a few hours before midnight.
Instead of being home at 6p.m. it meant going to meetups more often than not.
Instead of being home during weekends it meant flying to California for a
conference on a weekend on my private budget. Despite getting 2.5 days a week
from March to June to work on Berlin Buzzwords from my employer for the first
two years and having lots of help and knowledge over at newthinking who did the
heavy lifting of taking on the financial risk, managing registrations, booking
the venue and handling speaker travel support it still meant lots of additional
mornings, evenings and weekends spent on making the event fly (and an inbox that
never went silent - neither at noon nor at midnight - hint: any mail you send to
info@berlinbuzzwords ends up not only in an anonymous mailing list - every 
organiser including Simon Willnauer, Daniela Bentrup and myself will receive
your mail and make sure it gets dealt with).
<br><br>

There are <a
href="http://blog.isabel-drost.de/posts/are-devs-contribution-to-oss-happier107.html">a
couple of reasons</a> I kept doing this kind of stuff. But I guess the most
influential reason is simply that it also is a whole lot of fun for me.
<br><br>

There were several fellow students at school who didn't have the courage to
follow their dreams from the very start: There's the girl who was teased into
studying biology by her parents - only years later she had the courage to go for
professional gardening. There's this guy who didn't know exactly what to do and
followed many of his friends to study mechanical engineering. Months later he
pivoted towards social sciences and politics, today working on a PhD. thesis
on economics in German hospitals. There's the girl who successfully passed her
math degree but really also wanted to follow her musical passion - in the end
she went to study music in addition to become a math and music teacher.
<br><br>

It takes determination and courage to follow your dreams - especially if that
means following a different path than what your parents had on their mind for
you or following a path that doesn't quite fit into the clich√© of what society
has in mind for you*. However in my statistically absolutely non-significant,
completely biased and personal opinion it's worth every effort.
