# Learning German in Berlin

So you have been living in Berlin for a while, maybe even for years – but you fail to speak German fluently. It may feel weird switching to German even with friends, as your English gives you many more options to speak proficiently, to be precise when talking. People around you speak better English than you speak German.

One thing to remember: While Berlin is easy to navigate speaking only English, if you stay here for more than a couple of weeks you really truly do want to start training your German language skills: Emergency information – typically first available and more detailed in German. Dealing with public admin tasks – you’ll need German. You have kids – you need German language skills for medical appointments, for public admin, for Kindergarten and school. Even just getting quick access to news articles requires at least a basic understanding of the local language. And that is true if you want to relocate here, or if you consider yourself a digital nomad.

So here’s a writeup of things I’ve sent to too many friends already:

One warning at the very beginning: You must tell people that you want to learn German – find people who are patient enough to stay in German even if you are proficient in English. Otherwise a lot of people will quickly switch back to English which doesn’t help you.

## Online resources to get you started

* [Goethe Institut](https://www.goethe.de/de/index.html) operates globally, also has online resources for people learning German.
* [Tagesschau in simple German](https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/sendung/tagesschau_in_einfacher_sprache) is a simple German language version of the public (meaning independent) daily news show.
* [Deutsche Welle](https://learngerman.dw.com/de/deutsch-lernen/s-9095) has several radio shows and podcasts for German learners.
* [Berlin library](https://www.voebb.de/) gives you access to both, paper books, online access to local newspapers, Libby and Onleihe for digital books for 10 Euro each year. All you need to do is visit a library in Berlin, get your access card.
* For a lot of fun stories check out the kids show [Die Sendung mit der Maus](https://www.wdrmaus.de/).
* For book recommendations – also for new books – checkout [Stiftung Lesen](https://www.stiftunglesen.de/).

There’s a ton of podcasts that also public news agencies make available. Take your favourite podcast app to find them.


## For kids

Having grown up in east Germany until I was nine I realized that there’s a ton of traditional kids literature that many people take for granted, that in some cases was new to me. So here’s me list of authors you should check out and a more general page on must read books.

Stiftung Lesen above covers a ton of book recommendations also for children of different ages. You want to checkout things around the yearly book fairs.

* [Ada und Zangemann](https://dpunkt.de/produkt/ada-und-zangemann/) … a personal favorite on open source and ice cream. I’m not biased at all ;)
* [Kindermann Verlag](https://www.kindermannverlag.de/produkt-kategorie/weltliteratur-fuer-kinder-ab-6-jahren/) has lovely kids versions of famous literature.
* [Annette Betz](https://www.ueberreuter.de/produkt-kategorie/musikalisches-bilderbuch/) has a lovely collection of books to make classical music accessible to kids.

* [Cornelia Funke](https://corneliafunke.com/de/) … has books for all ages and is a must read.
* [Otfried Preußler](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otfried_Preu%C3%9Fler)
* [Erich Kästner](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_K%C3%A4stner)

* [Das Sams](https://www.oetinger.de/special/das-sams)

For more recommendations there’s an enitre list of [classical kids books](https://buchszene.de/deutschsprachige-kinderbuch-klassiker/).

For more recent titles:
* [Die Schule der magischen Tiere](https://www.carlsen.de/die-schule-der-magischen-tiere/alle-baende-im-ueberblick)
* [Das Neinhorn](https://www.carlsen.de/hardcover/das-neinhorn/978-3-551-51841-5) … so hilarious

* [Wieso, weshalb, warum](https://www.ravensburger.de/de-DE/produkte/kinderbuecher/wieso-weshalb-warum) … same as above for younger children.

One final parting note: One thing you can try is finding a language buddy - that could even be someone at work with the deal being you speak German on every other day, a language that you speak at native level the remaining days :)
