# Teddy in Atlanta


While I was happily attending Apache Con US in Atlanta/GA my teddy had a closer look at the city: He first went to the 
centennial olympic park, took a picture of the world of coca-cola (wondering what strange kinds of museums there are in 
the US. <br><br><img src="http://isabel-drost.de/Bilder/wordpress/teddy_atl_1.png"><br><br>After that he headed over to 
Midtown having a quiet time in the Piedmont park. And finally had a closer look at the private houses still decorated 
for Halloween. Seems like it was squirrel day that day: Met more than ten squirrels he told me.<br><br><img

arts museum on my camera after his trip out – as well as several images taken at the campus of the Georgia tech 
university. It's amazing to see what facilities are available to students – especially compared to the equipment of 
German universities.
