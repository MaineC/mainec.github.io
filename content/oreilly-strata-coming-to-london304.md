# O'Reilly Strata coming to London


O'Reilly Strata is coming to London. The first edition of Strata back in 2011 brought Big Data developers, designers, 
scientists and decision makers together to discuss all things scalable. This year in October the conference comes to 
Europe: <a href="http://strataconf.com/strataeu">O'Reilly Strata EU</a> will take place in 
London.<br><br><strong>Date:</strong> October 1st - 2nd 2012<br><br><strong>Venue:</strong> Hilton London Metropole, 
225 Edgware Road, London W2 1JU, UK<br><br>The schedule covers a great deal of use cases and war stories that involve 
big data and data driven development. Both days are packed with both deep technical but also strategy level 
presentations that can help drive your projects. <br><br>Having been on the <a 
href="http://strataconf.com/strataeu/public/content/about">program committee</a> I got a glimpse of the diversity and 
high quality of the submissions received. Choosing the best wasn't easy, but there's only so much content you can 
sqeeze in two conference days.<br><br>Looking forward to London.<br><br>PS: If you have any interesting war stories and 
anti-patterns involving big data to share consider <a
