# WiFi at the Apache Hadoop Get Together


Just a brief reminder: The next Apache Hadoop Get Together is scheduled to take place on Thursday, January 27th at 
6p.m. at the Zanox Event Campus at Media Spree Berlin.<br><br>We have three very interesting talks, though thirty 
guests registered already, we still have a few free seats. Head over to the <a 
href="https://www.xing.com/events/apache-hadoop-january-2011-655428">xing event page</a> to register if you have not 
done so yet.<br><br>If you would like to have access to the local WiFi please let <a href="mailto:isabel@apache.org">me 
know</a> - I need to register your mail address for that two days before the event with the venue.<br><br>A huge thanks 
to Zanox for providing the location for free, another huge thanks to Cloudera for sponsoring video taping of the event.
