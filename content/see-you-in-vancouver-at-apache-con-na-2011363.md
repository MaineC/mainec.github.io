# See you in Vancouver at Apache Con NA 2011


<img src ="http://na11.apachecon.com/attachments/0002/0347/speaker-234x60.gif" style="float:left"/> Mid November Apache 
hosts its famous yearly conference - this time in Vancouver/Canada. They kindly accepted my presentations on <a 
href="http://na11.apachecon.com/talks/19905">Apache Mahout for intelligent data analysis</a> (mostly focused on 
introducing the project to new comers and showing what happened within the project in the past year - if you have any 
wish concerning topics you would like to see covered in particular, please let me know) as well as a more committer 
focused one on <a href="http://na11.apachecon.com/talks/19488">Talking people into creating patches</a> (with the goal 
of highlighting some of the issues new-comers to free software projects that want to contribute run into and initiating 
a discussion on what helps to convince them to keep up the momentum and over come and obstacles).<br><br>Looking 
forward to seeing you in Vancouver for Apache Con NA.<br><br>
