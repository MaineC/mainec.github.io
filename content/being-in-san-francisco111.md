# Being in San Francisco


I spent the last two weeks together with Thilo in San Francisco - and neighboring areas. I had asked beforehand for 
recommendations on where to go and what to do, had purchased a "Rough Guide to California" as well as a "Lonely Planet 
guide for San Francisco". In addition I shared my arrival and departure times with a few people I know here. As to be 
expected our schedule quickly grew until it exploded, so we ended up doing greedy optimisation stuffing things in and 
putting them out again while we went along. Result of all that: An amazing two weeks that went by way to fast and the 
conclusion that we do need to return and bring way more time next time around.<br><br>A huge thanks for the warm 
welcome, for shared local knowledge on where to go, invitations for lunch or dinner, as well as fun hours at the Castro 
during Halloween. Special thanks to Datameer who when asked for accommodations recommendations kindly offered to host 
us - it makes such a big difference to get the chance to stay in a local neighborhood and avoid hotels altogether. All 
in all it's amazing to fly across an ocean, cross multiple time zones and arrive in a city that almost feels like being 
home.<br><br>Following a brief overview of what our final schedule turned out to be - happy to share pictures we took 
privately. After getting our car on Sunday, we went over to Berkeley to see their impressive campus - and got to see 
part of the Berkeley occupy movement.<br clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Day one was reserved for sports</h2><br><br><img

style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>After biking the bridge we went down to Sausalito. Got 
some delicious food at <a href="http://www.331fish.com/">fish</a> - a restaurant serving all sorts of healthy and tasty 
fish dishes. After that we went out on a canoe from <a href="http://seatrek.com/">Sea Trek Kayaking</a>, taking a 
closer look at the house boat community and a brief tour over to the Sausalito ferry port. When back at the shore we 
cycled to Sausalito and took the ferry to SFO.<br clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Day 2 was booked for Highway #1 to Santa 
Cruz</h2><br><br><img src="/sfo_2011_day3.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>We headed down scenic Highway#1, past the cliffs at Half 
Moon Bay. Went out for a hike in Butano park to hug some Redwood trees and take pictures of a fairy-tale like forest. 
Then headed over to Pigeon Point Lighthouse - even if you are not into staying at hostels you should stop there: this 
place is great for a nice view of the ocean and the lighthouse itself. Finally we went down to beautiful Santa Cruz.<br

src="/sfo_2011_day4.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>Not much to be said here: It's always impressive to walk 
underneath huge Redwood trees and go hiking in the mountains around to get a better view.<br 
clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Weekend for Yosemite</h2><br><br><center><img

src="/sfo_2011_day6.jpeg" height="200" 
style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>Took the route via Highway 140 - the drive itself was 
interesting already as it took us to quite a different country side than what we had seen until then. Got through 
Mariposa in the end over to Midpines. We stayed at <a href="http://www.yosemitebug.com/">friendly Bug Rustic 
Mountain</a> - classified as Hostel, features a spa with sauna and whirlpool. We were lucky enough to arrive on Friday 
before Halloween to get to see the screening of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" - including a printed transcript with tag 
lines to be shouted at the screen for those who do not know these already.<br><br>On Saturday we went hiking in amazing 
Yosemite park. Only then I realized how close different landscapes can be: It took us only half a day by car to go from 
coast and ocean over to high mountains. We chose to hike to the upper Yosemite fall - returning after 7m of rather 
steep trails on a sunny but fortunately quite clear day we were absolutely tired.<br clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Day 7 
Halloween</h2><br><br><img src="/sfo_2011_day8.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>We spent Halloween morning over in St. Helena and went to 
the <a href="http://www.franciscoppolawinery.com/">Francis Ford Coppola Winery</a>. Hard to believe, but several tasty 
types of Californian wine do exist - at least that's what Thilo confirmed when in St. Helena.<br><br>Evening was booked 
for dressing up and going to the Castro, though presumably more calm than in past years the area is still a must-go for 
Halloween if you are into watching people walking around in impressing costumes.<br clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Day 8 for 
Alcatras</h2><br><br><img src="/sfo_2011_day9.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>Not much to be added here - don't miss if you visit 
SFO.<br clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Day 9 for China town</h2><br><br><img 
src="/sfo_2011_day10.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>After several busy days we only went to China town that 
day and tried to recover for the rest of the afternoon - and went out for Dia de los Muertos in the evening.<br 
clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Day 10 for watching whales</h2><br><br><img 
src="/sfo_2011_day11.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br>Happy I took sea-sickness pre-cautions on that one. It 
was a bit of a rough ride with the catamaran. But in the end we got to see whales close to Farallon Islands. The 
naturalist did a great job explaining not only the life of the whales but also provided some background on the 
islands.<br clear="all"/><br><br><h2>Day 11 for Point Reyes and North Beach</h2><br><br><img 
src="/sfo_2011_day12b.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-top:10px"/><br><br><img 
src="/sfo_2011_day12a.jpeg" height="100" 
style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:0px"/><br><br>In the morning we followed the recommendation to get to 
see North Beach - if you like Friedrichshain/ Kreuzberg in Berlin or Dresden Neustadt - do not miss North Beach in San 
Francisco.<br><br>The afternoon was reserved for driving over to Point Reyes Lighthouse. Though we did not spot any 
whales in the water, the landscape already was amazing by itself.<br clear="all"/><br><br><br><h2>Day 12 - final walk 
through SFO</h2><br><br><center><img src="/sfo_2011_day13.jpeg" height="100" 
style="margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px"/></center><br><br>We took some time to walk along Hayes street, through the 
Golden Gate park up to Cliff House and went back with a Muni bus to the city - just too long to walk right back.<br

style="margin-right:20px;margin-top:10px"/></center><br><br>Thanks again to Stefan, St.Ack, Jon, JD, Ted, Ellen, Doug, 
Anne, Johan, Doris, Jens, Lance, Felix, Markus and everyone else who helped make this trip as awesome as it really was. 
Sorry to everyone who I did not manage to meet or get in touch - hopefully we can fix that next time I'm here - or next 
time you are in Berlin.<br clear="all"/>
