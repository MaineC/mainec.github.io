# Apache brand name - survey


Sally Khudairi (VP, ASF Marketing & Publicity) asked for distributing the following survey to people who might be 
interested in contributing their views to a study on how the brand name Apache is perceived. Me personally, I would be 
especially interested in finding out more on whether there are any differences in perception inside the ASF vs. 
outside...<br><br><blockquote><br>We have been working with PhD candidate Roland Schroll over the past two years as 
he's been compiling information on the value of the Apache brand. His advisor is community-based innovation expert Dr. 
Johann FÃ¼ller. This is a joint project of the University of Innsbruck and the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology.<br><br>If you have 10 minutes to help, it would be much appreciated. The survey is at 
http://surveys.hyvelive.de/10_apache/p1.php?refGroup=Apache <br><br>They would like the surveys to be completed this 
month (February). <br><br>They are seeking at least 300 respondents. As such, if you know others who are interested in 
Apache from a market perspective, feel free to forward the link to them as well.<br><br>Thanks in advance for your 
interest!<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Sally Khudairi<br>VP, ASF Marketing & Publicity<br></blockquote><br><br>
