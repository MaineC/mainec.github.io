# Berlin Buzzwords - Early bird registration


I would like to invite everyone interested in data storage, analysis and search to join us for two days on June 7/8th 
in Berlin for <a href="http://berlinbuzzwords.de">Berlin Buzzwords</a> - an in-depth, technical, developer-focused 
conference located in the heart of Europe. Presentations will range from beginner friendly introductions on the hot 
data analysis topics up to in-depth technical presentations of scalable architectures.<br><br>Our intention is to bring 
together users and developers of data storage, analysis and search projects. Meet members of the development team 
working on projects you use. Get in touch with other developers you may know only from mailing list discussions. 
Exchange ideas with those using your software and get their feedback while having a drink in one of Berlin's many 
bars.<br><br><a href="http://berlinbuzzwords.de/content/tickets">Early bird registration</a> has been extended until 
April 17th - so don't wait too long.<br><br>If you would like to submit a talk yourself: <a

one week. More details are available online in the call for presentations:<br><br>Looking forward to meeting you in the 
beautiful, vibrant city of Berlin this summer for a conference packed with high profile speakers, awesome talks and 
lots of interesting discussions.
